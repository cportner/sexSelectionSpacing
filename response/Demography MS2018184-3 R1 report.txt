I already liked the previous version of this paper. I think the author has done a good job incorporating most of my comments and those of the other reviewers. Even though I would sometimes have made different choices (for example, including fewer figures), the choices the author has made are well understandable and appropriately motivated. I think the paper is a useful contribution to Demography and my advice is to accept it.

I apologize for the delay.
