The article was a careful, innovative, and thorough piece of research picking up on a conundrum concerning how son preference and sex selection affect birth intervals. I very much enjoyed reading this piece and think it has useful applications outside of India.  My review is short as I do not see much to be improved upon.  My only (minor) suggestion concerns the use of the word "spell".  It is very clear what you mean by a spell when the paper explains this, but I think that it is somewhat confusing to put this in the abstract without an explanation.  It was not until I got to the explanation in the methods that I understood the abstract fully.  I suggest rewording this section of the abstract so it is clear what is meant by spell.
