India has long shown a strong preference for boys, especially in the
northern states \citep{Kishor1993,murthi95,arnold98}. 
This son preference manifest itself both in mortality and fertility outcomes.
Mortality risk is higher for females than males, resulting in an almost
continuous increase in India's ratio of males to females over the last century 
\citep{dyson01,Navaneetham2011}.
Similarly, families are more likely to cease childbearing after the birth of 
a son than after a daughter \citep{Das1987,Arnold1997,arnold98,clark00,dreze01,Basu2010}.
