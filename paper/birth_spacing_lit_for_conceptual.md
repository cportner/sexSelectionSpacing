Shorter breastfeeding the higher the education.
Amenorrhea for women with no education was 16.4 months, compared to 8.4 months for women 
with six or more years of education 

As was shown in other studies, increases in mother's age or parity were associated with
longer amenorrhoea. Amenorrhoea lasted longer for older women and those of higher
parities than for younger women. This may reflect a biological delay in the hormonal
mechanisms responsible for ovulation. Older women are also known to take longer to
conceive than younger women. It has been suggested that this may, in part, be caused
by higher rates of anovulation. Foetal loss rates are also higher among older than among
younger women.

Mother's education was negatively associated with the duration of amenorrhoea.
When age at first supplementation was included, the education effect ceased to be
significant. This may reflect cultural practices that affect suckling patterns differentially.
Women with longer education may use bottles more frequently and this would be likely
to replace suckling at the breast.

It has previously been shown that women with longer education in Matlab generally come
from wealthier families.18 The use of liquid supplements (such as milk which can more
easily be afforded by richer women) might supplant breastmilk more than the use of
solid supplements.

Mother's nutritional status defined by weight at pregnancy termination, was found
to be negatively associated with the duration of post partum amenorrhoea in this
population. The median duration of amenorrhoea is four months longer among women
with weights in the lowest quartile (< 38 kg) compared to those in the highest quartile
(> 44 kg).

The association between mother's nutritional status and the duration of amenorrhoea
may be related to that between malnutrition of the mother and variations in suckling
patterns. Malnourished mothers produce less milk and might thus have hungrier
infants who suckle more frequently and more intensely. Other studies on lactational
capacity of Bangladeshi mothers have shown that mothers' nutritional status is
directly associated with breastmilk output: heavier women or those with larger arm
circumferences produced more milk, and milk with a higher fat content, than those with
lower measures.

## The Effects of Breastfeeding and Nutrition on Fecundability in Rural Bangladesh: A Hazards-Model Analysis

[no information on women's education used]

In this study, we examine the waiting time to conception in a poorly
nourished group of women in rural Bangladesh by focusing on the monthly
probability of conceiving, or fecundability. We wish to know whether or
not fecundability varies among women, and, if so, to what extent a
woman's fecundability depends upon her nutritional status and upon her
breastfeeding behaviour during her menstruating interval.

The variables representing nutritional status have no significant effect
on the monthly probability of conception: neither height (the index of
chronic malnutrition) nor w/h2 (the index of acute malnutrition) play an
important role in determining the length of the waiting time to
conception. The failure to find a nutrition effect is consistent with
other studies of fecundability noted earlier.

Alternatively, it is possible that in the absence of covariates
describing the pattern of breastfeeding, an effect of nutritional status
might become evident, suggesting that the woman's breastfeeding
behaviour and her nutritional status were highly correlated. Model 3,
which contains no breastfeeding variables, disproves this hypothesis:
the nutritional status variables still have no significant effect on
fecundability. Furthermore, the exclusion of the breastfeeding variables
significantly reduces the explanatory power of the model.

The breastfeeding variables show a clear effect of the pattern of
breastfeeding - both by type and duration - upon fecundability. At any
given duration of the menstruating interval, a woman who has been giving
her infant food other than breastmilk for less than six months is more
likely to conceive than is a woman who is still fully breastfeeding her
child.

In this study, in which the most detailed data yet available have been
used, it is found that nutrition above famine or starvation levels is
not a significant determinant of the capacity of a woman to conceive.

Undoubtedly the most striking finding of this study is the effect of the
pattern of breastfeeding on the monthly probability of conception: as a
woman begins to wean her child, her probability of conceiving increases,
presumably the result of decreased levels of serum prolactin which
inhibit ovulation.

## Women’s Education and Fertility: An Analysis of the Relationship between Education and Birth Spacing in Indonesia
Kim 2010 - EDCC
\citep{Kim2010}

The theories on optimal birth spacing developed by Wolpin
(1984) and Newman (1988) imply that a couple with a steeper income
profile over its life cycle has an incentive to space births more widely
in the absence of perfect capital markets.

When the return to education increases as the economy
becomes more industrialized, the slopes of the wage profiles for more
educated women and their less educated counterparts are likely to
diverge. I test this possibility by examining whether the level of
industrialization had a differential impact on education groups.

Access to modern contraceptive methods lowers the cost
for delaying childbearing (Bulatao and Lee 1983; Easterlin and Crimmins
1985).

Before modern contraceptives were available, the birth
interval was likely to reﬂect length of breastfeeding due to postpartum
amenorrhea as lactation may provide some contraceptive effect due to
postpartum amenorrhea but this effect diminishes over time (Meredith,
Menken, and Chowdhury 1987; Sigle 1998).

With a family planning program in place, if more educated
women are better able to learn new contraceptive technology, as
suggested by Schultz (1975), they will space births further apart
because of better access to modern birth control methods and their
ability to use these methods correctly, regardless of breastfeeding
patterns.

The results imply that changes in the effect of education
on birth spacing in Indonesia over the period 1974–90 were primarily
driven by changes in the availability of contraceptives rather than
through changes in the demand for children. These results can be
interpreted as evidence for the hypothesis that education enhances the
ability to understand and use new information in the context of
contraceptive technology,

One common implication of dynamic fertility models
regarding income variation is that a couple facing a more rapidly
growing income profile is likely to space births more widely in the
absence of perfect capital markets (e.g., Wolpin 1984; Newman 1988). 8

The literature suggests that highly educated women tend
to breastfeed for a shorter duration because they have a higher
opportunity cost of time, can afford to buy substitutes for breast milk,
or may think of breastfeeding as undignified (e.g., Wolfe and Behrman
[1982] for Nicaragua, Oni [1985] for Nigeria, Barrera [1990] for the
Philippines, and Appleton [1996] for Ivory Coast).

The observation among the later cohorts is consistent
with findings from other diverse settings that higher female education is
associated with longer second birth intervals (see Newman and McCulloch
1984; Heckman, Hotz, and Walker 1985; Tasiran 1995; and Johnson-Hanks
2004).

When the interaction terms are included under the
fixed-effects estimation, as in column 5 of table 7, the differential
effect of education on birth hazard indeed disappears both in terms of
magnitude and significance. Instead, the interaction between education
and the existence of a family planning clinic has a significant and
negative impact on birth hazard, which is consistent with the hypothesis
that more educated women are better at adopting new contraceptive
methods. Therefore, the differential effect of education on birth
spacing over time is primarily driven by change in the availability of
contraceptives, rather than by change in the demand for children.

among earlier cohorts, women who are more educated tend
to have shorter birth intervals than those who are less educated and
that the opposite is true among later cohorts.

The empirical results based on the first hypothesis show
that the level of industrialization of the local economy does not have a
differential effect on birth spacing across educational groups. However,
empirical results using measures of the availability of a family
planning program show a differential effect on delaying births across
educational groups.

women’s education had an impact on the second birth
interval mainly through changing the availability of contraceptives
rather than through change in the demand for children over the period
1974–90.

My findings are consistent with the hypothesis that more
educated women are better at adopting new contraceptive technology.
