**Sex selective abortions in India: a practice that continues to our days**

***Summary.** In India, the male-to-female ratio at birth has increased
since the mid-1980s. 
**Claus Pörtner** shows that the increasing use of sex selection 
substantially lengthened birth intervals. 
This rapid lengthening, in turn, is responsible for a
significant downward bias in the total fertility rate compared to
predicted cohort fertility.*

### Introduction {.unlisted .unnumbered}

The introduction of ultrasound in India in the mid-1980s ushered in an era of increasing 
use of sex-selective abortions. 
Figure [-@fig:sr-tfr] that starting in the mid-1980s, the percentage boys began increasing
from around 52% and is now close to 52.5% (the elevated sex ratio pre mid-1980s is because 
deceased girls are less likely to be reported in surveys).

Even though the increased availability of pre-natal sex determination facilitated the 
increasing sex ratio, the main driver of the expanding use of sex-selective abortions 
was the rapidly declining fertility.
Hindu families appear to have a strong desire to have one son, but once that 
son is secured they do not show a strong son preference [@Jayachandran2017;@Portner2015b].
If the desire is for one son, more than 99 percent of families would achieve that if 
they were willing to have up to six children. 
However, if the desire is for one son and a maximum of two children, about 25 percent of 
families have to resort to sex selection to simultaneously achieve both targets.
Over the 1972 to 2016 period, India's total fertility rate (TFR) declined from around from 
around 5.5 to just over 2 as shown in Figure [-@fig:sr-tfr].

As striking as these overall numbers are, they obscure three important aspects of the 
changes in India.
First, the massive differences across education levels that followed with the 
availability of pre-natal sex determination.
Second, that the use of sex selection differs significantly by parity.
Third, that each sex-selective abortion delays the next birth by 6 to 12 months, 
resulting in longer durations between births, which can bias our estimates
of fertility and our predictions of future fertility decline.

In a recent paper, I use data from India to examine how fertility,
sex ratio, and birth spacing have changed from 1972 to 2016, focusing on the 
effects of the spread of sex selection by education levels [@Portner2022].
The data comes from the first four National Family and Health Surveys.
I restrict the analysis to Hindu women since Hindus constitute about 80% 
of India's population and have in past shown stronger son preference
and significantly higher use of sex selection than Muslim.

To illustrate the results, Figure [-@fig:spell] shows the probability of a third birth, 
the sex ratio at the third birth, and the 75th percentile birth intervals after the 
second child for rural women with no education and urban women with 12 or more years of 
education.
These two groups represent the extremes in India and exemplify the divergent behaviors in 
response to son preference.
The analyses cover four periods: 1972--1984, 1985--1994, 1995--2004, and 
2005--2016.

### Falling fertility, but son preference still affect the likelihood of a next birth {.unlisted .unnumbered}

First, consistent with the declining overall fertility, the likelihood of a next birth has 
decreased over time for all parities. 
However, the probability of having another child remained higher for women without sons 
than for women with one or more sons, showing the continued strong son preference in India.

Consistent with these general trends, both groups of women in Figure [-@fig:spell] have 
experienced a decline in the probability of having a third child and are more likely to 
have a third child if they have two daughters already than if they have one or two sons.
However, in line with much higher fertility with lower education, more than 75% of
rural women with no education still have a third birth no matter the sex of their prior 
children.
Constrast this with the well-educated urban women, where less than 20% have a third
child if they already have a boy, while more than 50% have a third child if they have 
only daughters, down from 45% and 70%, respectively, in the 1970s.


### The use of sex selection is not declining {.unlisted .unnumbered}

Second, despite predictions that sex selection will eventually decline in India,
there is no clear evidence of this yet. 
The most likely users of sex selection---better educated women with no sons---continue to 
show substantial male-biased sex ratios. 
More concerning, increasingly male-biased sex ratios among less-educated mothers suggest 
that sex selection is spreading as the fertility of this group falls.

The sex ratios for the well-educated urban women in Figure [-@fig:spell] illustrate 
well how the sex ratios have become increasingly more male-dominated for mothers with no 
sons as access to sex selection spread. 
For this group, we are fast approaching a situation where 80% of the third births are boys,
reflecting that, as desired fertility declined, more and more women used sex selection
to secure a boy before they stopped childbearing.

The situation is very different for the rural women with no education.
Their fertility is still high and the chance of having a son without sex selection is
correspondingly high.
Hence, there is still no evidence of sex selection for this group, 
although this might change in the future as fertility declined further.


### Modest increases in birth intervals, except with sex selection {.unlisted .unnumbered}

Based on the estimated sex ratios at birth, we can split Indian births into two broad 
groups.
The first is where there is no evidence of sex selection, which includes births to
better-educated mothers with at least one son and to all less-educated mothers whether 
they have a son or not.
The second is where there is evidence of sex selection, which includes births to 
better-educated mothers with no sons. 

For births where sex selection is not used, the median birth intervals have increased 
relatively little---only three to six months over the four decades---compared to around 
3.5 months *per decade* in other countries with declining fertility [@Casterline2016].
Even when sex selection is not used, there is still strong evidence of the son preference 
in India, as illustrated by the shorter interval to the next birth when rural women
with no education have only daughters than when they have at least one son.

What is more, a remarkably high proportion of birth intervals are still very short. 
Except for among the most educated women, 25% or more have their second child within
24 months of their first child, and a similar proportion have their third child within 
24 months of having their second.
Both birth intervals are substantially below the WHO recommended 24 months between 
pregnancies, which, especially for less-educated mothers, significantly raising the 
mortality risk for both the children born and the prior children 
[@Bocquier2021;@Portner2022]. 

The story is very different when sex selection is used. 
Well-educated mothers with no sons had substantial lengthening of birth intervals, further 
evidence of very significant use of sex-selective abortions. 
For example, among the mothers with 12 or more years of education with no daughters, the 
75th percentile birth interval length is now nearly 70 months, a 21-month increase over 
four decades. 
Strikingly, more than 70% of this increase occurred in the first decade after the 
introduction of sex selection.
Therefore, some mothers with no sons now have *longer* birth intervals than those with 
sons, reversing India's traditional spacing pattern.


### Spread of sex selection made us overestimate fertility decline {.unlisted .unnumbered}

One of the unappreciated effects of a rapidly expanding use of sex selection and the 
associated increases in birth intervals is that it makes the TFR a downward-biased 
estimate of cohort fertility [@Bongaarts1999;@Hotz1997;@Ni-Bhrolchain2011].
That is precisely what appeared to have happened in India. 
The period fertility rate substantially overestimated how fast cohort fertility fell in 
the 1990s and early 2000s, as spacing initially increased with the spreading use of sex 
selection. 
Although the two fertility measures have recently partly converged, predicted cohort 
fertility is still 10%--20% higher than the period fertility rate. 
To boot, predicted cohort fertility is still at or above replacement level for all but 
the best-educated urban mothers.

These results paint a less rosy picture of India's prospects for a continued reduction in 
population growth than generally accepted. 
With predicted cohort fertility still substantially higher than the period fertility rate, 
India's TFR will likely stabilize or even increase as birth intervals slow their 
lengthening. 
Perversely, the more successful the attempts at combatting sex selection are, the more 
likely an increase in the TFR will be. 
This increase comes partly from reducing the length of birth intervals if sex-selective 
abortions are unavailable and partly from families needing more births to reach at least 
one son.
