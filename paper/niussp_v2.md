**Sex-selective abortions in India: a practice that continues to our days**

*Claus C. Pörtner*

**BIO.** Department of Economics, Albers School of Business and

Demography and Ecology, University of Washington, USA.

***Summary.** In India, the male-to-female ratio at birth has increased
since the mid-1980s. 
**Claus Pörtner** ties the continuously growing use of sex selection to India's falling 
fertility among well-educated women. 
He shows how sex selection  substantially lengthened birth intervals, which, in turn, is 
responsible for a significant downward bias in the 
total fertility rate compared to the predicted cohort fertility.
Less-educated women still have relatively high fertility and short birth intervals when 
they have no sons, negatively affecting girls' survival chances.*

### Introduction {.unlisted .unnumbered}

With the mid-1980s introduction of ultrasound, India saw a rapidly spreading use of
sex-selective abortions, as shown by the steadily increasing percentage of boys in 
Figure [-@fig:sr-tfr].
However, access to pre-natal sex determination does not necessarily lead to sex selection.
Rather, in India, the practice was driven by the combination of declining fertility---also
shown in Figure [-@fig:sr-tfr]---and
the particular Hindu son preference, where the desire is for a son, but once that son is 
secured, there is no clear son preference [@Jayachandran2017;@Portner2015b].
If a family is willing to have up to six children, there is a 99% probability of achieving
the goal of one son.
However, if the desire is for one son *and* a maximum of two children, about 25 percent 
of  families must use sex selection to achieve both targets.

As striking as these overall numbers are, they obscure three critical aspects of the 
changes in India.
First, the massive differences across education levels that followed the 
availability of pre-natal sex determination.
Second, that sex selection use differs significantly by parity.
Third, how sex selection increased birth intervals, which, in turn, made us
significantly overstate the rate of fertility decline in India.

In a recent paper, I use data from India from 1972 to 2016 to examine how fertility, sex 
ratio, and birth spacing changed by education level with the spread of sex selection 
[@Portner2022].
The data comes from the first four National Family and Health Surveys.
I focus on Hindu women because Hindus constitute about 80% of India's population and have 
shown stronger son preference and higher use of sex selection than Muslims.

To illustrate some of the results, Figure [-@fig:spell] shows the probability of a third 
birth, the third birth sex ratio, and the 75th percentile birth intervals after 
the second child for rural women with no education and urban women with 12 or more 
years of education.
These two groups represent the extremes in India and exemplify the divergent behaviors in 
response to son preference.
The analyses cover four periods: 1972--1984, 1985--1994, 1995--2004, and 2005--2016.

### Falling fertility, but son preference still affects the likelihood of a subsequent birth {.unlisted .unnumbered}

First, consistent with the declining overall fertility, the likelihood of a subsequent 
birth has decreased over time for all parities. 
However, the probability of having another child remained higher for women without sons 
than for women with one or more sons, showing the continued strong son preference in India.

Consistent with these general trends, both groups of women shown in Figure [-@fig:spell] 
show a declining likelihood of having a third child and are more likely to 
have a third child if they have two daughters already than if they have one or two sons.
However, more than 75% of rural women with no education still have a third birth no matter 
the sex of their prior children.
Contrast this with the well-educated urban women, where less than 20% have a third
child if they already have a boy, while more than 50% have a third child if they have 
only daughters.


### The use of sex selection is not declining {.unlisted .unnumbered}

Second, despite predictions that sex selection will eventually decline in India,
there is no clear evidence to support this idea. 
The most likely users of sex selection---better-educated women with no sons---continue to 
show substantial male-biased sex ratios. 
More concerning, increasingly male-biased sex ratios among less-educated mothers suggest 
that sex selection is spreading as the fertility of this group falls.

The well-educated urban women in Figure [-@fig:spell] illustrate the increasingly 
male-dominated sex ratios for mothers with no sons as access to sex selection spread. 
For this group, we are fast approaching a situation where 80% of the third births are boys,
reflecting that, as desired fertility declined, more and more women used sex selection
to secure a boy before they stopped childbearing.

The situation is very different for the rural women with no education.
Their fertility is still high, and the chance of having a son without sex selection is
correspondingly high.
Hence, there is still no evidence of sex selection for this group, 
although this might change in the future as fertility declines further.


### Modest increases in birth intervals, except with sex selection {.unlisted .unnumbered}

Based on the estimated sex ratios at birth, we can split Hindu births into two broad 
groups.
The first group is where there is no evidence of sex selection, which includes births to
better-educated mothers with at least one son and all less-educated mothers whether 
they have a son or not.
The second is where there is evidence of sex selection, which includes births to 
better-educated mothers with no sons. 

For births where sex selection is not used, the median birth intervals have increased 
relatively little---only three to six months over the four decades---compared to around 
3.5 months *per decade* in other countries with declining fertility [@Casterline2016].
Even though sex selection is not used, there is still strong evidence of son preference, 
as illustrated by the shorter birth intervals when rural women with no education have 
only daughters than when they have at least one son.

What is more, a remarkably high proportion of birth intervals are still very short. 
Except for among the most educated women, 25% or more have their second child within
24 months of their first child, and a similar proportion has their third child within 
24 months of having their second.
Both are substantially below the WHO recommended 24 months between pregnancies, which
significantly raises child mortality risk, especially for less-educated mothers 
[@Bocquier2021;@Portner2022]. 

The story is very different when sex selection is used. 
Well-educated mothers with no sons had substantial lengthening of birth intervals, further 
evidence of very significant use of sex-selective abortions. 
For example, among the well-educated urban mothers with no daughters, the 75th percentile 
birth interval length is now nearly 70 months, a 21-month increase over four decades. 
Strikingly, more than 70% of this increase occurred in the first decade after the 
introduction of sex selection.
Therefore, some mothers with no sons now have *longer* birth intervals than those with 
sons, reversing India's traditional spacing pattern.


### Spread of sex selection made us overestimate fertility decline {.unlisted .unnumbered}

One of the unappreciated effects of a rapidly expanding use of sex selection and the 
associated increases in birth intervals is that it makes the TFR a downward-biased 
estimate of cohort fertility [@Bongaarts1999;@Hotz1997;@Ni-Bhrolchain2011].
That is precisely what appeared to have happened in India. 
The period fertility rate substantially overestimated how fast cohort fertility fell in 
the 1990s and early 2000s, as spacing increased with the spreading use of sex selection. 
For example, the TFR for urban women with 12 or more years of education went from
2.1 to around 1.6 with the introduction of ultrasound but predicted cohort fertility 
declined only from 2.3 to 2.1.
Although the two fertility measures have recently partly converged, predicted cohort 
fertility is still 10%--20% higher than the period fertility rate. 

These results paint a less rosy picture of India's prospects for a continued reduction in 
population growth than generally accepted. 
With predicted cohort fertility still substantially higher than the period fertility rate, 
India's TFR will likely stabilize or even increase as birth intervals slow their 
lengthening. 
Perversely, the more successful our attempts at combatting sex selection are, the more 
likely an increase in the TFR will be. 
This increase comes partly from reducing the length of birth intervals if sex-selective 
abortions are unavailable and partly from families needing more births to reach at least 
one son.
