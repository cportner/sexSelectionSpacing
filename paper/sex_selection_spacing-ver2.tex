\noindent 

Strong son preference is typically associated with shorter birth spacing
in the absence of sons, but access to sex selection has the potential to
reverse this pattern because each abortion extends spacing by six to
twelve months. 
I introduce a statistical method that simultaneously
accounts for how sex selection increases the spacing between 
births and the likelihood of a son. 
Using four rounds of India's National
Family and Health Surveys, I show that, except for first births,
the spacing between births increased substantially over the last four
decades, with the most substantial increases among women most 
likely to use sex selection.
Specifically, well-educated women with no boys now
exhibit significantly longer spacing and more male-biased sex ratios
than similar women with boys. 
Women with no education still follow the standard
pattern of short spacing when they have girls and little evidence of sex
selection, with medium-educated women showing mixed results. 
Finally,
sex ratios are more likely to decline within spells at lower parities,
where there is less pressure to ensure a son, and more likely to
increase or remain consistently high for higher-order spells, where the
pressure to provide a son is high.

\section{Introduction\label{sec:intro}}

Parents' spacing of births has long served as a measure of son preference 
\citep{Leung1988}.
Before prenatal sex determination became available, the only recourse for 
parents who wanted a son---but did not yet have one---was to have the next 
birth sooner.
Son preference is therefore often associated with shorter spacing after the 
births of girls than boys 
\citep{Das1987,Rahman1993,Pong1994,Haughton1996,Arnold1997,Soest2012,Rossi2015}.
Shorter spacing is, in turn, associated with worse health outcomes for girls 
and mothers 
\citep{arnold98,Conde-Agudelo2000,Whitworth2002,Razzaque2005,Rutstein2005,Conde-Agudelo2006}.%
\footnote{
Parents are also more likely to cease childbearing after the birth of 
a son than after a daughter 
\citep{repetto72,ben-porath76b,Das1987,Arnold1997,arnold98,clark00,dreze01,filmer09,Basu2010,Altindag2016}.
}

However, the introduction of prenatal sex determination fundamentally changed the 
relationship between son preference and birth spacing.
Couples, who had shorter birth spacing before because of son preference,
now have access to prenatal sex determination and sex-selective abortions,
and each abortion increases birth spacing by six months to a year.
The increase consists of three parts.
First, starting from the time of the abortion, the uterus needs at 
least two menstrual cycles to recover;  otherwise, the likelihood 
of spontaneous abortion increases substantially \citep{zhou00b}.
The second part is the waiting time to conception, which is between 
one and six months \citep{Wang2003}.
Finally, sex determination tests are reliable only from three months 
of gestation onwards.

As a result, we now have a situation where we may observer \emph{longer} spacing
for families with daughters than for families with sons, precisely because
strong son preference leads them to use sex selection.
Working in the opposite direction, couples with strong son preference
will likely still try to conceive earlier in the absence of sons. 
They may even shorten the time until conception, knowing that they might
have to go through multiple pregnancies and abortions before they
conceive a son.
To further complicate matters, we can still observe shorter birth spacing 
after the births of daughters as a representation of son preference for 
families who---for one reason or another---do not use prenatal sex selection.

Spacing, by itself, can therefore no longer be used as a direct measure of 
son preference, but understanding birth spacing remains a critical undertaking.
First, 
birth spacing is still useful in understanding son preference, 
if combined with the likelihood of observing a boy or a girl.
Second, 
the duration between births may be an important factor in parents' 
decisions, either for preference or economic reasons.
It is, for example, possible that even parents with strong son preference 
may reverse their decision to use prenatal sex determination---and carry 
the next pregnancy to term whether male or female---as the duration from 
the previous birth becomes sufficiently long.

At a broader level, we know less about what determines spacing behavior in 
developing countries than in developed countries.%
\footnote{
Even the effects of access to contraceptive on spacing are uncertain.
On the one hand, access to contraceptives allows women to avoid too 
short spacing between birth, which would increase birth spacing.
On the other hand, increased reliability of access and effectiveness of
contraceptives can lead to shorter spacing between births 
\citep{Keyfitz1971,Heckman1976}.
With less reliable contraception parents choose a higher level 
of contraception, which results in longer spacing, to avoid having 
too many children by accident.
But, as contraception becomes more effective parents can more
easily avoid future births, allowing them to reduce the spacing 
between births without having to worry about overshooting their 
preferred number of children.
This idea may explain why better-educated women have
shorter spacing than less educated women in some instances
 \citep{Tulasidhar1993,Whitworth2002}.
These two counteracting effects may explain why finding statistically 
significant effects of contraception use on birth spacing is 
difficult \citep{Yeakey2009}.
}
With increasing numbers of women entering the labor force in developing
countries, understanding how couples make timing decisions will be necessary
for the design of suitable policies \citep{Portner2018}.
Furthermore, if spacing does affect health outcomes for mother and children, it is 
essential to understand what drives changes in spacing.
We know, for example, that health outcomes for girls appear to improve
in the presence of sex selection \citep{Lin2014,Hu2015}.
It is possible that these improvements are an unintended side-effect of
the longer spacing that arises from sex-selective abortions, rather than
because the smaller number of girls makes them more valued as is often
assumed.


In this paper, I introduce and apply a novel empirical method that directly incorporates 
the effects of sex-selective abortions on 
the duration between births
\emph{and} 
the likelihood of a son. 
The method can be used to analyze both situations with and without prenatal
sex selection.
My proposed method allows for the time since the previous 
birth to affect the decision on sex selection.
By examining under what circumstances sex selection decisions change with 
spacing, we can draw a more nuanced picture of the degree of son preference.

% [Why India?]
I apply the method to birth histories of Hindu women, using data from 
India's National Family and Health Surveys (NFHS), covering the period 
1972 to 2016. 
India is a particularly compelling case.
On the one hand, India has seen dramatic increases in the males-to-females ratio 
at birth over the last three decades as access to prenatal sex determination 
expanded 
\citep{das_gupta97,Sudha1999,Arnold2002,retherford03b,jha06}.%
\footnote{
India is not alone; both China and South Korea saw
significant changes in the sex ratio at birth over the same period 
\citep{Yi1993,park95}.
}
On the other hand, research suggests that son preference in 
India, when measured as ideally having more boys than girls, is decreasing 
over time and with higher education \citep{bhat03,pande07}.
% %
% \footnote{
% This measure of son preference is commonly used in the literature. 
% See, for example, \citet{clark00}, \citet{Jensen2009}, and \cite{Hu2015}.
% }

There have also been substantial changes in access and legality of
prenatal sex determination in India over the period covered.
Abortion has been legal in India since 1971 and still is.
The first reports of sex determination appeared around 
1982--83 \citep{Sudha1999,bhat06,Grover2006}.
The number of clinics quickly increased, and knowledge about sex selection 
became widespread after a senior government official's wife aborted a 
fetus that turned out to be male \citep[p.\ 598]{Sudha1999}.
In 1994, the Central Government passed the Prenatal Diagnostic Techniques 
(PNDT) Act, making determining and communicating the sex of a fetus illegal.%
\footnote{
Details about the act are at \href{http://pndt.gov.in/}{http://pndt.gov.in/}.
The number of convictions has been low.
It took until January 2008 for the first state, Haryana, to reach five convictions.
Hence, private clinics apparently operate with little risk of legal action 
\citep{Sudha1999}.
Furthermore, there is little evidence that bans like this significantly
affect sex ratios \citep{Das-Gupta2016}.
}
% Hence, the data make it possible to show how the spacing between births and
% sex ratios have changed with the introduction of prenatal sex determination,
% and whether the ban affected the relationship between birth spacing and sex 
% ratios.


% [Results]
There are four main results.
First, there has been a general increase in the length of spacing between births
over the four decades covered by the data.
The exception is for first births, where the median duration has either
remained the same or slightly declined, although this hides a
significant compression of the variation in spell length.
Second, the most substantial increase in spacing is for the women who
are most likely to use sex selection.
Specifically, among the best-educated women, those with no boys now has 
significantly longer spacing---and a more male-biased sex ratio---than 
similar women with boys.
Third, women with no education still follow the standard pattern of
short spacing when they have girls and little evidence of the use of sex
selection.
In other words, these women adhere to a strategy where they achieve a
son through higher fertility rather than the use of sex selection.
Finally, sex ratios are the most likely to decline within spells at
lower-order spells, where the pressure to provide a son is smaller, and
are more likely to increase or remain consistently high for higher-order
spells, where the pressure to ensure a son is high.

\section{Estimation Strategy\label{sec:strategy}}

% Requirements for method and the intuition behind each:  
%  - Account for censoring (hazard model)
%  - Work both with and without sex selection (competing risk part)
%  - Allow for changes in use of sex selection within spell (flexible specification of baseline hazard ?)
%  - Capture that the shape of the hazard function differ across groups
%    (non-proportionality); needs a better description, maybe using example
%    of shorter spacing and/or use of sex selection. Differences in parity
%    progression likelihood. 

The unit of analysis is a spell, the period from one birth---or for the first spell from 
marriage---to the next birth.
The model is a discrete time, non-proportional, competing risk hazard model with two exit 
states: either a boy or a girl is born.
The standard approach in the spacing literature is to use a single-exit model, but with
access to sex selection the sex of the next child is not random and parents' choices 
will impact the spacing to a girl or a boy differentially.%
\footnote{
\cite{Merli2000} used a discrete hazard model to examine whether 
there were under-reporting of births in rural China, although they 
estimated separate waiting time regressions for boys and girls.
}
Both the non-randomness and differential spacing can be captured with a competing risk set 
up.

I use a non-proportional hazard specification, which allows the shape of the hazard 
functions to vary across groups, rather than the standard proportional hazard function 
for three reasons.
First, it is unlikely---even in the absence of prenatal sex determination---that the 
effect of household characteristics such as the sex composition of previous births have 
the same effect throughout the entire spell.%
\footnote{
Assuming that the effect of sex composition is the same throughout a spell is especially 
problematic for higher-order spells where different sex composition of previous births can 
lead to substantial differences both in the likelihood of progressing to the next birth and
how soon couples want their next child if they are going to have one.
}
Second, the introduction of prenatal sex determination likely exacerbates any bias 
from the proportionality assumption since sex-selective abortion use varies across groups,
which affects birth spacing, and because a household's use of sex selection may vary 
within a spell, which means that the effects of covariates vary within the spell as well.
Finally, the use of a non-proportional specification mitigates any potential effects 
of unobserved heterogeneity when used in conjunction with a flexible baseline hazard 
\citep{Dolton1995}.

For each woman, $i=1,\ldots,n$, the starting point for a spell is time $t=1$, and 
the spell continues until time $t_i$, when either a birth occurs or the spell 
is censored.%
\footnote{
The time of censoring is assumed independent of the hazard rate,
as is standard in the literature.
}
There are two exit states: the birth of a boy, $j=1$, or the birth of a girl, $j=2$, and 
$J_i$ is a random variable indicating which event took place.
The discrete time hazard rate $h_{ijt}$ is specified as
\begin{equation}
 h_{ijt} = \frac{\exp(D_j(t) + \alpha_{jt}'\mathbf{Z}_{it} + \beta_j'\mathbf{X}_{i})} 
 {1 + \sum_{l=1}^2 \exp(D_j(t) + \alpha_{lt}'\mathbf{Z}_{it} + \beta_l'\mathbf{X}_{i})} \: \: \; \; \;  j = 1,2
 \label{eq:hazard}
\end{equation}
where the explanatory variable vectors, $\mathbf{Z}_{it}$ and $\mathbf{X}_{i}$, capture 
individual, household, and community characteristics discussed below,
and $D_{j}(t)$ is the piece-wise linear baseline hazard for outcome $j$, captured
by dummies and the associated coefficients,
\begin{equation}
D_j(t) = \gamma_{j1} D_1 + \gamma_{j2} D_2 + \ldots + \gamma_{jT} D_T,
\end{equation}
with $D_m = 1$ if $t=m$ and zero otherwise.
This approach to modeling the baseline hazard is flexible and does not place 
overly strong restrictions on the baseline hazard.

The explanatory variables in $\mathbf{Z}$ and the interactions between them 
are the non-proportional part of the model, which means that they are
interacted with the baseline hazard:
\begin{equation}
 \mathbf{Z}_{it} = D_j(t) \times (\mathbf{Z}_1 + Z_2 + \mathbf{Z}_1 \times Z_2),
\end{equation}
where $D_j(t)$ is the piece-wise linear baseline hazard and $\mathbf{Z}_1$ captures sex 
composition of previous children, if any, and $Z_2$ captures area of residence.
The remaining explanatory variables, $\mathbf{X}$, enter proportionally,
but to further minimize any potential bias from assuming proportionality, estimations 
are done separately for different levels of mothers' education and for different 
time periods.

Equation (\ref{eq:hazard}) is equivalent to the logistic hazard model and has the same 
likelihood function as the multinomial logit model \citep{allison82,jenkins95}.
Hence, transforming the data, so each observation is an interval---here equal
to three months---the model can be estimated using a standard multinomial logit model.%
\footnote{
The multinomial model assumes that alternative exit states are stochastically independent
(Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives or IIA), which rules out any individual-specific 
unmeasured or unobservable factors that affect both the hazard of having a girl and the 
hazard of having a boy.
I, therefore, include a proxy for fecundity discussed in Section \ref{sec:data}.
Also, the multivariate probit model can be used as an alternative because the IIA is not 
imposed \citep{han90}.
The results are substantially identical between these two models and
available upon request.
}
In the reorganized data the outcome variable is 0 if the woman does not have a child in a 
given interval (the base outcome), 1 if she gives birth to a son in that interval, and 2 
if she gives birth to a daughter in that interval.

The distribution of spacing is captured by the survival curve, which shows the probability 
of not having had a birth yet by spell duration, for a given set of explanatory variables.
The survival curve at time $t$ is 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:survival}
S_{t} 
= 
\prod_{d=1}^t
\left(
\frac{ 1 }
{1 + \sum_{l=2}^2 \exp(D_j(t) + \alpha_{ld}'\mathbf{Z}_{kd} + \beta_l'\mathbf{X}_{k})}
\right).
\end{equation}

Because the probability of ever having a next birth likely varies across groups, a direct 
comparison of standard survival curves tells us little about how the spread of sex selection 
affects birth spacing across groups.
I, therefore, condition on the predicted likelihood of parity progression when examining 
birth spacing measures, such as the median duration to a birth.
The reliability of this approach depends on whether the spell length covered is 
sufficiently long that few women are likely to give birth after the spell cut-off.
I discuss the choice of spell length below.%
\footnote{
It is important to note that the approach is not the same as merely calculating 
the birth spacing measures for women who already have a given 
parity child in the survey because that number does not take into account
the censoring of spells that will eventually lead to a birth.
}
In addition, I also present graphs of both standard survival curves and
survival curves conditional on parity progression (which therefore
begin at 100\% and end at 0\%).

Interpretation of the model coefficients is challenging \citep{thomas96}.
It is, however, possible to calculate the predicted probabilities of 
having a boy, $b$, and of having a girl, $g$, in period $t$, conditional on 
a set of explanatory variables and not having had a child before that period, as
\begin{align}
P(b_{t} | \mathbf{X}_{k}, \mathbf{Z}_{kt}, t ) 
& =  
\frac{ \exp(D_j(t) + \alpha_{1t}' \mathbf{Z}_{kt} + \beta_1' \mathbf{X}_{k} )}
{1 + \sum_{l=1}^2 \exp(D_j(t) + \alpha_{lt} ' \mathbf{Z}_{kt} + \beta_l ' \mathbf{X}_{k})}
\label{eq:probability_boy} \\
P(g_{t} | \mathbf{X}_{k}, \mathbf{Z}_{kt},t ) 
& =  
\frac{ \exp(D_j(t) + \alpha_{2t}'\mathbf{Z}_{kt} + \beta_2'\mathbf{X}_{k} )}
{1 + \sum_{l=2}^2 \exp(D_j(t) + \alpha_{lt}'\mathbf{Z}_{kt} + \beta_l'\mathbf{X}_{k})}
\label{eq:probability_girl}
\end{align}
It is then straightforward to calculate the estimated percentage of children born that 
are boys, $\hat{Y}$, at each $t$:  
\begin{equation}
\hat{Y}_t 
= 
\frac{ P(b_{t} | \mathbf{X}_{k}, \mathbf{Z}_{kt},t )}
{ P(b_{t} | \mathbf{X}_{k}, \mathbf{Z}_{kt},t) + P(g_{t} | \mathbf{X}_{k}, \mathbf{Z}_{kt},t )} 
\times 100.
\label{eq:probability_son}
\end{equation}
Combining the percentage boys and the likelihood of exiting the spell 
across all $t$ gives the predicted percent boys born over the entire spell.
In addition to the predicted percent boys over the entire spell, 
I also present graphs of how the percentage boys born vary across time
within a spell, together with the associated confidence interval for given 
values of explanatory variables calculated using the Delta method.


\section{Data\label{sec:data}}

The data come from the four rounds of the National Family Health Survey 
(NFHS-1, NFHS-2, NFHS-3, and NFHS-4),
collected in 1992--1993, 1998--1999, 2005--2006, and 2015--2016.%
\footnote{
A delay in the survey for Tripura means that NFHS-2 has some observation 
collected in 2000.
}
The surveys are large: NFHS-1 covered 89,777 ever-married women 
aged 13--49 from 88,562 households;
NFHS-2 covered 90,303 ever-married women aged 15--49 from 92,486 households;
NFHS-3 covered 124,385 never-married and ever-married women aged 
15--49 from 109,041 households;
and 
NFHS-4 covered 699,686 never-married and ever-married women aged
15--49 from 601,509 households surveyed.

I exclude visitors to the household, as well as
women who have been married more than once, divorced, or who are 
not living with their husband,
women with inconsistent age at marriage,
and those with missing information on education.
Women interviewed in NFHS-3 or NFHS-4 who were never married or where Gauna 
had not yet been performed were also dropped.
The same goes for women who had at least one multiple births,
reported having a birth before age 12, had a birth before marriage, or
duration between births of less than nine months.
Women who reported less than nine months between marriage and first birth
remain in the sample---unless they are dropped for another reason---because 
8.5\% fall into this category across the four surveys.
Although it is possible that some of these births are premature, the high number of
women who report a birth less than six months after their marriage indicates that for
a majority conception likely occurred before marriage.

Finally, I restrict the sample to Hindus,
who constitute about 80\% of India's population.
If the use of sex selection differ between Hindu and other religions, such 
as Sikhs, assuming that the baseline hazard is the same would lead to bias.
The other groups are each so small relative to Hindus that it is not
possible to estimate different baseline hazards for each group.
Furthermore, the other groups are so different in background and son 
preference that combining them into one group would not make sense.

There are four advantages to using the NFHS.
First, surveys enumerators pay careful attention to spacing between births and
probe for ``missed'' births.
Second, no other surveys cover as extended a period in the same amount of detail.
The four NFHS rounds allow me to show how spacing and 
sex ratio changed from before sex-selective abortions were available until 2016.
Third, NFHS has birth histories for a large number of women.
% %
% \footnote{
% The Special Fertility and Mortality Survey appears to cover a much large number of households
% than the three rounds of the NFHS combined, but \citet{jha06} only use the births that 
% took place in 1997 making their sample sizes by parity smaller than here.
% Their sample consists of 133,738 births of which 38,177 were first-born, 
% 36,241 second-born, and 23,756 were third-born.
% }
Finally, even if probing for missing births does not eliminate recall error,   
the overlap in cohorts covered and the large sample size makes it possible 
to establish where recall error remains a problem.

Recall error arises mainly from child mortality when respondents are 
reluctant to discuss deceased children.
Systematic recall error, where the likelihood of reporting a deceased 
child depends on the sex of the child, is especially problematic because 
it biases both spacing and sex ratios.
Probing catches many missed births, but systematic recall error is 
still a potentially substantial problem.

Three factors contribute to the problem here.
First, girls have significantly higher mortality risk than boys.
Second, son preference may increase the probability that parents recall boys 
more readily than girls.
Finally, in NFHS-1 and NFHS-2 enumerators probed only for a missed birth if the
initially reported birth interval was four calendar years or more,
but, given short durations between births, especially after the birth of a girl,
that procedure is unlikely to pick up all missed children.

Recall error is heavily dependent on how long ago a woman was married 
\citep{Portner2018b}.
I, therefore, drop women married 22 years or more 
for NFHS-1, with the corresponding cut-off points 23 years for NFHS-2, 
and 25 years for NFHS-3 and NFHS-4.
The final sample consists of 
\input{../tables/num_women.tex}
% [number] women, with [number] parity one through four births.


\subsection{Spell Definition\label{sec:spell_def}}

As mentioned above, 8.5\% of women gave birth less than nine months
after they were married, and the first spell, therefore, begins at the 
month of marriage.
The exception is for women married very young, where I use the month they 
turned 12.
The second and subsequent spells begin nine months after the previous birth 
because that is the earliest we should expect to observe a new birth.
A few women report births that occurred less than nine months 
after the previous birth; I drop those women from the sample as mentioned above.

All spells continue until either a child is born or censoring occurs.
Censoring can happen for three reasons:
the survey takes place;
sterilization of the woman or her husband;
or too few births are observed for the method to work.
For the first spell I set censoring because of too few births to 108 months 
(nine years) after marriage,
while for the second, third, and fourth spells censoring is at 96 months 
(eight years) after a birth can occur.
With these cut-offs, less than one percent of observed births occur after
the spell cut-off.%
\footnote{
\input{../tables/num_missed.tex}
Recall also that these numbers are totals across all 36 separate regressions.
}


I group spells into four periods based on the year of marriage
or year of the previous birth:
1972--1984, 1985--1994, 1995--2004, and 2005--2016.
The periods follow the main changes in availability and legality of 
prenatal sex determination discussed in the Introduction.
The allocation into periods is determined by when conception and therefore 
decisions on sex selection can begin, even if we do not observe
any births until nine months later.

The allocation into periods means that some spells cover two periods.
A couple may, for example, be married in 1984, but not have their first 
child until 1986.
That couple's first spell will be in the 1972--1984 period, even though 
most of the interval falls in the 1985--1994 period.
Hence, prenatal sex determination was likely available when some
children from spells that began in the 1972--1984 period were conceived,
which could result in evidence of sex-selective abortions even for this
period.
Similarly, a spell that started in the 1985--1994 period may have been partly 
or mostly under the PDNT act.
The effect is a downward bias in the differences between the periods.

\subsection{Explanatory Variables}

I divide the explanatory variables into two groups.
The first group consists of variables expected to affect the shape of the hazard function
(the $\mathbf{Z}$ variables): 
mother's education, sex composition of previous children, and area of residence.
I chose these variables because the prior literature shows that they affect 
spacing choices and correlate with sex selection.
Increasing the number of variables interacted with the baseline hazard would
further lower the risk of bias but at the cost of requiring more data to 
precisely estimate.

I divide women into three groups based on education attainment: no
education, one to seven years of education, and eight and more years of education.
The models are estimated separately for each education level to reduce
the potential problem of including other variables as proportional.
Increasing education of mothers correlates closely with lower fertility 
\citep{schultz97}, and 
we should expect lower fertility to lead to more use of sex selection.%
\footnote{
Fathers' education has two opposite predicted effects: the associated higher income
should increase fertility and therefore lower the pressure to use sex selection, but
the higher income also makes the use of sex selection cheaper.
In practice, fathers' education had little effect on the hazards and the use of 
sex-selective abortions, and I, therefore, do not include it.
}

I capture sex composition with dummy variables for the
possible combinations for the specific spell, ignoring the ordering of births.
As an example, for the third spell, three groups are used: Two boys,
one girl and one boy, and two girls.
It is, in principle, possible to estimate the model taking into account
the ordering of children, but this would further lower the power of the
test, by adding one additional group for the third spell and four
additional groups for the fourth spell. 
As discussed, the sex composition of previous children affects both the timing
of births and the use of sex-selective abortions.

Area of residence is a dummy variable for the household living in
an urban area.
The cost of children is higher in urban areas than in rural areas, and 
there is easier access to prenatal sex determination in urban areas.
Both factors are likely to lead to higher use of sex-selective abortions
in urban than in rural areas.

The second group of variables consists of those expected to have an 
approximately proportional effect on the hazard.
These include the length of the first spell 
(for the second and higher-order spells to capture fecundity), 
the age of the mother at the beginning of the spell, 
whether the household owns any land, 
and whether the household belongs to a scheduled tribe or caste.
We cannot observe fecundity directly, but the time from marriage until 
first birth is a suitable proxy because most Indian women do not use 
contraception before the first birth and there is pressure to show that 
a newly married woman can conceive \citep{dyson83,Sethuraman2007,Dommaraju2009}.
The absence of contraception before the first birth is confirmed below by the 
very short spells between marriage and first birth, even among the most educated.
Hence, a long spell between marriage and first birth is likely due to low fecundity.
For both duration from marriage to first birth and the age of the mother at the 
beginning of the spell, I also include their squares.
The remaining variables are dummies for household ownership of land and membership
of a scheduled caste or tribe.


\subsection{Descriptive Statistics}

Appendix Table \ref{tab:des_stat1} presents descriptive statistics for
the spells by education level and period they began.
There is a substantial number of censored observations.
As an example, for highly educated women who had their first child in the 2005--2016
period, more than 40\% did not have their second child by the time of the survey.
Censoring becomes even more important for the third and fourth
spells, with around 70\% of the observations censored.
The level of censoring also increases with parity and time,
which reflects a combination of factors: timing of the surveys
relative to the periods of interest, later beginning of childbearing, 
falling fertility, and the increase in spell lengths from 
sex-selective abortions.

The share of urban women in the sample has fallen slightly over the
periods, even though India's population has become progressively more urbanized.
For the first and second periods, over 32\% of the women 
entering the first spell lived in urban areas, falling to 
30\% for the third period and 26\% in the last period.
The most likely explanation is that the age of marriage has increased
faster in urban areas than in rural areas.
Hence, there are relatively more urban women, but fewer show up in the
sample because they are not yet married.

The population has become substantially better educated over time.
Women with no education constituted almost 60\% 
in the first period, but less than twenty percent in the last period.
Correspondingly, in the first period just over twenty percent had eight or more 
years of education, whereas in the last period more than 60\% did.
These changes are an underestimate of the increase in female
education overall because many of the younger women with more education
have not yet married than therefore are not in the sample.%
\footnote{
Women with eight or more years of education accounted for 65.9\% of
unmarried women in NFHS-3 and 82.8\% of unmarried women in NFHS-4.
See \citet[p 56]{International-Institute-for-Population-Sciences-IIPS2007}
and \citet[p 61]{International-Institute-for-Population-Sciences-IIPS2017}
for more information.
 }

Age at marriage increased over time across all three education groups.
The most substantial increase was for women without any education, where
the average went from below 16 years of age to 18.5.
The smallest change is for the most educated women where the average age
at marriage went up by less than a year---from 19.6 to 20.4---across the 
four periods.


\section{Results\label{sec:results}}

% [Hypotheses / questions]

The overall hypothesis is that spacing patterns significantly changed 
as prenatal sex determination became available.
To address this, I examine three questions in order of importance.

First, did the spacing after girls increase relative to the spacing
after boys?
The underlying hypothesis is that in the absence of sex selection son 
preference leads to shorter spacing after the birth of a girl than after the 
birth of a boy, whereas son preference increases the spacing after the birth 
of a girl relative to after the birth of a boy when prenatal sex selection is 
available.
I still expect parents to \emph{try} to conceive earlier after the birth 
of a girl than after a boy, but the abortions will increase the 
duration between births, and may even lead to longer spacing after the
birth of girls than after boys.


Second, have the shapes of the survival curves changed?
The shapes of the survival curves provide information both on general
changes in birth spacing and whether parents are
still trying to conceive earlier after girls than boys.
I expect this to be the case if there is still a strong preference for
boys, and, as discussed above, this behavior may even become more pronounced
with access to sex selection.


Finally, does the sex ratio change within a spell?
There are two reasons why this is interesting.
First, if the sex ratio changes within a spell, relying on the observed sex
ratio at birth---as is standard practice in the literature---will not provide
correct estimates of the use of sex selection or the sex ratio at
the conclusion of childbearing.
Second, any changes in the sex ratio within a spell provides clues
to parents' preferences over the ideal spacing between births and the
distribution of son preference in the sample.


% [How to read tables]
Tables \ref{tab:median_sex_ratio_low}, \ref{tab:median_sex_ratio_med}, and
\ref{tab:median_sex_ratio_high}
show the predicted median duration and sex ratios by period, spell, and sex 
composition for the three education levels separated by area of residence.%
\footnote{
Appendix Tables \ref{tab:p25_p75_low}, \ref{tab:p25_p75_med}, and 
\ref{tab:p25_p75_high} show 25th and 75th percentiles durations.
} 
For each subsample, I first estimate the model described in Section 
\ref{sec:strategy} and then use the estimated coefficients to predict 
median duration and sex ratio.
For the standard errors, I use bootstrapping for both measures,
where the model is repeatedly estimated using resampling with replacement.


The predicted median duration is the weighted average over the women in the 
subsample, using the individual probabilities of giving birth as weights.
For each woman in a sample, I calculate her probability of ending the spell 
with a birth, and her contribution to median spacing is how long it will take
from the beginning of the spell to where she is predicted to reach half of that probability.
For example, if a woman has an 80\% probability of having a birth by the end of 
the spell, her median duration is the number of months it takes to reach
40\% probability of having exited with a birth.
The 40\% is equivalent to the 60\% point on a standard survival curve because that 
captures how many have not yet exited.

For the second through the fourth spell, I show whether durations for sex 
composition other than only girls are statistically significantly different 
from the duration with only girls.
To calculate the level of statistical significance, I bootstrap the
difference in spacing.
 
The cleanest test is comparing durations after only boys with durations after
only girls, but the number of births to women with only sons becomes small 
in the later periods.
Hence, it is possible to have substantial differences in spacing that are
not statistically significant because of low power, especially for the third 
and fourth spell.

The predicted sex ratio is the weighted average over the women in the sample's 
individual predicted sex ratios, using the individual probabilities of having
given birth by the end of the spell as weights.
Each woman's predicted sex ratio is the weighted average of the predicted
percentage boys over the months in the spell calculated using equation 
(\ref{eq:probability_son}) and the probability of giving birth in each month 
as weights.%
\footnote{
Imagine a spell has two periods and that the estimated percentage boys for a
woman are 54\% and 66\% and that the likelihood of having a birth is 20\% and 40\%.
The likelihood of having a birth is the change in the survival curve; 
in other words, there is 40\% chance that she will not have given birth by the end of 
this spell.
This woman's percentage boys is then $\frac{54*0.2+66*0.4}{0.2+0.4} = 62$.
}
The predicted sex ratio captures the percent boys that will have been born to women 
in the sample when childbearing for that spell is over.

Each predicted percent boys is tested against the natural percentage 
boys using the bootstrapped standard errors.
The natural sex ratio is approximately 105 boys to 100 girls or
51.2\% \citep{ben-porath76b,jacobsen99,Portner2015b}.
The predicted percentage boys may differ from the natural rate because of 
natural variation, any remaining recall error not corrected for, or 
sex selection. 

\subsection{No Education Women}

\input{../tables/bootstrap_duration_sex_ratio_low.tex}

Women with no education follow a pattern consistent with son
preference with shorter spacing when they have only girls compared 
to when they have one or more sons, and the differences are often 
statistically significant as shown in Table \ref{tab:median_sex_ratio_low}.
Most of the women without education live in rural areas,
whereas there are relatively few urban women with no education.
There are especially very few urban women to based the third
and fourth spell results on, and I therefore focus on rural women.

Predicted median duration has increased over time within
each sex composition.
The exception is for the first spell, where there is little
change, and possibly even a small decline.

The differences in duration across sex compositions increase with 
spell number.
For the second spell, the difference in median duration between
having a girl or a boy as the first-born are mostly between a half
and one month.
For the third spell, the difference in duration between only girls 
and only boys is, on average, slightly over one month and statistically 
significant in all periods.
The differences for the fourth spell are between two and three months, 
except for the 1972--1984 period, which is also the only period where 
the difference is not statistically significant.

There are no clear time trends in the differences in median duration
across sex compositions or the predicted sex ratios across the four periods.
Despite that some sex ratios are statistically significantly higher 
than the natural sex ratio there is therefore little consistent evidence 
for the use of sex selection for women without education.
There has, for example, been relatively little change in the length
of spacing for rural women with two girls in the third spell and 
the predicted sex ratio was higher in the 1985--1994 period
than in the 2005--2016 period.
The possible exception is the fourth spell, where both duration 
and sex ratio has increased for women with three girls, although
the \emph{difference} across sex compositions has remained almost
the same.

\subsection{Middle Education Women}

\input{../tables/bootstrap_duration_sex_ratio_med.tex}

Women with one to seven years of education follow a pattern
broadly similar to those with no education as 
Table \ref{tab:median_sex_ratio_med} shows.
The sample size is more evenly distributed across urban and rural 
for this education group than for the no education women.
As a result, the only spells where there are few women to base 
results on are for the fourth spell for urban women and the first 
period of the fourth spell for rural women.

The spacing between births increased over the four decades.
On average, the increase is approximately three to four months.
The exception is again the first spell, where the time from
marriage to first birth remained the same or fell slightly.

In the period before sex selection became available, 1972--1985,
the differences in spacing between only girls and only boys
increase with between the second and third spell.
For both urban and rural women, the difference in duration is just over
a month for the second spell, but it is 1.4 and 2.8 months for urban and
rural women, respectively, for the third spell.
In the three later periods, there is no clear pattern
in the differences across sex compositions.

The differences in duration between only girls and only boys 
appear to decrease over time.
The exception is for the two later periods where the
differences are slightly larger in the last period compared
with the second-to-last period. 

The decreases in differences are accompanied by increases
in predicted sex ratios, some of which are statistically 
significantly different from the natural sex ratio.
Hence, even though the evidence is not substantial, it does
appear that women with one to seven years of education 
have begun to use sex selection at higher-order spells.

\subsection{High Education Women}

\input{../tables/bootstrap_duration_sex_ratio_high.tex}

Women with eight or more year of education mostly followed 
the traditional spacing pattern before sex selection became 
available as shown in Table \ref{tab:median_sex_ratio_high}.
Compared to the two other education groups there are,
however, more situations where the pattern is less clear.
Part of the problem may be that there are few women in
this group for the 1972--1984 period, and, hence, only 
the results for the first and second spells in both urban 
and rural areas are likely reliable.


Birth spacing increases substantially over time, 
especially for urban women. 
The median duration for urban women increases between a half
and a full year, whereas the increase for rural women 
is between a quarter and half a year.
The spacing between marriage and the first birth is still the
exception, and for this group of women, there is a decline of
about a month for both urban and rural areas.


In urban areas, the increase in spacing with only girls is so 
substantial that women with only girls have longer spacing to the 
next birth than any of the other sex compositions from 1985 onward.%
\footnote{
The exception is the second spell for the 1985--1994 period, where women
with one girl have 0.1 months shorter spacing the women with one boy.
}
This reversal in the standard spacing pattern is substantial, 
especially for the third and fourth spells.
For the latest period, the difference between only girls than the
other sex compositions is between 4.8 and 9.1 months for the third
and fourth spell.
Furthermore, the differences are statistically significant, except
for only boys for the fourth spell because few women have a fourth
birth if they have three boys already.


Rural women also show a reversal of the typical spacing pattern,
although the changes are less pronounced than for urban women.
The third spell shows that spacing for women with only girls become
increasing longer compared to the other two sex compositions.
Most of the differences are statistically significant, although they are 
smaller than for urban women.
For the second spell, there is little difference in spacing for
women with one girl and women with one boy.

The predicted sex ratios at the end of the spells show that
the reversal in spacing patterns is not the result of a declining son
preference but instead corresponds to a substantially more male-biased 
sex ratio.
For urban women, the predicted sex ratio with only girls 
is consistently above 60\% boys for the third and fourth spells.
For rural women, the predicted sex ratios are lower than for urban
women but still substantial and statistically significant at close 
to 60\%.
The high predicted sex ratios are presumably the result of increased 
use of sex selection.

When trying to understand the strength of son preference, it is interesting
that the sex ratio is also statistically significantly different
from the natural rate in the case where women already have one
son for the third and fourth spells.
Again, the sex ratio in the presence of one son for the third and
fourth spells are higher in urban areas than rural areas, although
the difference is less than for women with only girls.
Hence, it is possible that women are still willing to use sex selection
even after giving birth to one, although this behavior may also 
be in response to either experienced
or expected mortality of the first son born.

It also appears that there is a slightly elevated sex ratio among 
first-born for urban women. 
There is, however, no corresponding increase in spacing; instead,
the median duration has fallen over time and is the lowest among
the three education groups.
Hence, unless duration between marriage and first birth has decreased 
substantially by itself, for example, because of improved health, it
is not clear how much stock to place on the increased sex ratio
among first-borns as evidence for sex selection among first-borns.

Both of the last two results are different from prior studies using NFHS data.
There are two potential explanations.
First, the NFHS-4 is substantially larger than the three prior surveys.
Hence, it is possible that the effects have been there all along, but 
we did not have the power to detect them.
Second, it is possible that at least the first-born results are an
artifact of any recall error not captured by the data restrictions.
Certain types of recall error would also explain why the sex ratio for
the second spell and one boy is statistically significantly \emph{below} 
the natural sex ratio \citep{Portner2018b}.


\subsection{Distribution of Birth Spacing Across Sex Compositions and Time}

Median spacing is a convenient way to understand the overall changes but
may hide important differences in the distribution of spacing.
This section, therefore, provides more detail on how spacing is distributed
over time and sex compositions using a graphical approach.

I show survival curves conditional on predicted parity progression rather than
standard survival curves. 
The advantage of this approach is that it is possible to directly compare 
the distribution of spacing to next birth across groups, independently of 
differences in how likely the next birth is.
Because the conditional survival curves are independent of the likelihood
of final parity progression, they all begin at 100\% and end at 0\%.

Instead of averaging across the entire sample, I calculate the conditional
survival curves for an average woman using the method detailed in 
Section \ref{sec:strategy}.
For each combination of education and spell, I use values based on the
average age at the start of the spell and, for the second and higher
spells, the average duration of the first spell.
Furthermore, I use the majority categories for the categorical explanatory 
variables, which means no ownership of land and not in a scheduled caste or 
tribe.
The characteristics used do not change across period to ensure that 
composition effects do not drive the changes.

In the interest of brevity, I discuss only a select set of subsamples.
Figure \ref{fig:pps_spell1} shows spacing for the first spell across the
four periods for rural women with no education and urban women with 
eight or more years of education.
Figures \ref{fig:pps_low} and \ref{fig:pps_high} show spacing across sex
compositions for the second, third, and fourth spells for the first period, 
1972--1984, and the last period, 2005--2016, for rural women with no 
education and for urban women with eight or more years of education.
The Appendix shows standard and conditional survival curves for all groups and 
time periods, and I discuss some examples of standard survival
curves in the following section.%
\footnote{
To ease legibility of the graphs some three months intervals are combined
into longer ones when there are few births available in the sample.

\label{fig:pps_spell1}
\end{figure}

The biased sex ratio for the first spell for the most educated 
women suggests that there might be sex selection on the first birth.
I, therefore, begin by comparing in Figure \ref{fig:pps_spell1} how the distribution 
of spacing has changed over time for rural women with no education and urban women 
with eight or more years of education.
What is most striking is how similar the distribution of spacing is across the
two groups.

Both groups show little change in median spacing, but that masks a substantial
compression of when most of the births occur.
In the 1972--1984 period, the middle 80\% of births for women with no education 
are predicted to occur between approximately 6 and 64 months, whereas in the 
2005--2016 period it is between 12 and 54 months.
Hence, the compression is equivalent to more than a full year.
Women with eight or more years of education show a slightly smaller compression:
in the 1972--1984 period, the middle 80\% of births are predicted to occur between
approximately 6 and 48 months, whereas in the 2005--2016 period it is between
12 and 46 months.
Hence, the compression is eight months.

Women became less likely to conceive before marriage over time.
In the first two periods there was a relatively smooth decline in the number of
women without a birth starting at the time of marriage, but in the last two
periods, there are few women who exit early after marriage and
instead there is a substantial dip between 9 and 12 months after
marriage.

It is likely that the compressed spacing, beginning at nine months
after marriage in the later periods, is associated with better health
and higher age at marriage.
For example, women without education have seen an increase in the average 
age at marriage from below 16 to 18.5 from the first period to the last 
while women with the most education increased from 19.5 to 20.4.

\end{figure}

For women with no education, Figure \ref{fig:pps_low} shows that the median results
above are consistent with the distribution of spacing within a spell with spacing 
after only girls consistently shorter than after only boys.
There are slight variations in how strong this effect is across the three spells.
On the one hand, for the second spell the difference in spacing between
when the first child is a girl versus when the first child is a boy as
first-born remains almost the same across the four decades.
On the other hand, for the third spell the differences between two girls and 
the other sex compositions become more pronounced over time, and especially
the difference between two girls and two boys have become substantially larger.
The fourth spell results are based on relatively few observations but do
indicate that women with either only girls or two girls and one boy have
shorter spacing than women with only boys or one girl and two boys.
Although the evidence is not substantial, it does appear that there is a slight
preference for two boys in the sense that spacing becomes longer once the couple
has at least two boys than for the other sex compositions.

Survival curves conditional on progression to next birth for urban women with eight or

\label{fig:pps_high}
\end{figure}


The distribution of spacing for the second spell is almost indistinguishable 
between urban women with eight or more years of education and rural women 
with no education for the 1972--1984 period, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:pps_high}.
The small difference points to these two very different groups of women behaving similarly
in response to son preference in a situation where there was little access to
prenatal sex determination or little incentive to use it early even for those 
who might have had access.

Whereas the no education group show almost no change across the four decades,
the high education women show a rightward shift if the spacing pattern when
the first child is a girl.
The result is that the spacing patterns are close to identical after first-born 
girls and after first-born boys.
Given the elevated predicted percentage boys in Table \ref{tab:median_sex_ratio_high},
this change is consistent with the use of sex selection for women with a girl 
as their first child.

The hypothesized correlation between use of sex selection and reversal of 
the standard spacing pattern show up clearly in the 2005--2016 period for the 
third spell with spacing to the third child consistently longer with two girls 
than with either two girls or one boy and one girl.
The rightward movement for only girls from the, mostly, standard pattern in 
the 1972--1984 period to the new pattern in the 2005--2016 period is substantial.
There are also indications that the spacing distribution has moved rightward
for women with one boy and one girl relatively to women with two boys, which
provides some evidence for the use of sex selection for this group.
The caveat is that the 1972--1985 period also had a biased sex ratio, which
points to uncorrected recall error for this group.

There is an even more pronounced rightward shift for spacing after only
girls in the fourth spell for the first years of the spell. 
The caveat is that there are few births to base the results on,
especially for women with two or more sons.%
\footnote{
As mentioned, it is possible that some women had access to sex selection even
in the first period.
I would expect well educated urban women with more children to be the
most likely to know about and use this early access to prenatal sex determination.
}
Furthermore, the differences are substantial across most of the distribution.
Twelve months after the beginning of the spell there is a more than ten 
percentage points difference in the conditional survival curves for only girls
and only boys.
That is, of the women who are predicted to have a fourth child just over 30\%
of women with three boys have had their fourth child, while less than 20\% of
those with three girls have had theirs.
Even at three years after the beginning of the spell, there is a more than 
five percentage points difference.

As discussed above there is some evidence of a two-son preference with
the spacing pattern almost the same for women with three boys and with
two boys and one girl.
The conditional survival curve for women with one boy and two girls is
consistently above those for women with two or more son, but below those 
with three girls.
The pattern fit the predicted sex ratios shown above where the highest
predicted sex ratio is for women with only girls, followed by those
with one son and two girls, and those with two or more boys having
almost the same sex ratio.



\subsection{Does Sex Selection Change within Spells?}

The above results show that length of birth spacing increased 
more for women with only girls than for other sex compositions
as sex ratios became more male-biased, presumably because
of increased use of sex selection.
Neither the median spacing or the conditional survival curves,
however, can tell us whether sex selection varies \emph{within}
a spell or provide any information about the likelihood of
exiting a spell with a birth.
To understand both, I now turn to the standard survival curves
and predicted sex ratios by spell duration.

\label{fig:increasing_sex_ratio} 
\end{figure}

The predicted sex ratio may change within a spell for, at
least, two reasons.
First, parents may stop using prenatal sex determination within
a spell once the duration from the previous birth becomes long enough.
The desire for short spacing could, for example, arise from 
economies of scale in childbearing and rearing that parents lose 
if children are born too far apart \citep[p 374]{schultz97}. 
In this case, we should observe the predicted sex ratio decline
with spell length.

Second, if the degree of son preference varies across women within 
the sample, but their behavior is not affected by duration from the 
previous birth, we should observe an increasing share of births come from 
parents with stronger son preference as the duration from the
previous birth increases.
Whereas the early births are a combination of births to
people with lower son preference and those with stronger son
preference who conceived a son in the first or second pregnancy,
births later in the spell are then predominately from those with stronger
son preference who have not yet conceived a son.
In this case, we should see an increase in the sex ratio 
as duration increases.


Figures \ref{fig:decreasing_sex_ratio} and \ref{fig:increasing_sex_ratio} show
examples of how sex ratio behave within spells.
Both are for women with eight or more education since the results above indicate
that they are the most likely to use sex selection or other means of achieving 
an unequal sex ratio.
Figure \ref{fig:decreasing_sex_ratio} shows results for the second spell for
the 1995--2004 and 2005--2016 periods for women with a girl as their first
child by area of residence.
Figure \ref{fig:increasing_sex_ratio} shows results for the third spell for
the same two periods for urban women with either two girls or one boy and one
girl as their first two children.

Within the second spell, both urban and rural women show a declining
sex ratio as duration increases for the 1995--2004 period, whereas there
is little change, or possibly a small increase, with duration for the 
2005--2016 period.
These results are consistent with a situation where fertility is declining
over time leaving less room for a change in the decision to use sex selection.
Fertility decline is not immediately apparent from the second spell 
results, but the third spell shows that the likelihood of progressing from
two to third children declines by approximately 15 percentage points if
the woman has given birth to a boy.

The third spell figures show a very different situation with substantial 
increases in sex ratios.
The high sex ratio for women with two girls is likely 
motivated by the combined desire to limit fertility and ensure a son;
similarly to the situation for the second spell as shown in 
Figure \ref{fig:decreasing_sex_ratio} (b) and (d).

The increase in sex ratio with duration for women who already have
given birth to a boy likely illustrates the case where there is a
combination of degrees of son preference.
Say that one group wants one son and after that will not use sex
selection, whereas another group has a strong preference for two
sons (or either have or expect to lose the boy they already have)
and that the two groups conceive at the same rate.
In that case, we should expect precisely the increasing sex ratios
we observe, especially given the declining fertility over time.


\section{Conclusion\label{sec:conclusion}}


The central question addressed here is the extent to which spacing patterns 
significantly changed as prenatal sex determination became available.
Specifically, did the spacing after girls increase relative to the spacing
after boys?
The underlying idea is that in the absence of sex selection son 
preference leads to shorter spacing after the birth of a girl than after the 
birth of a boy, whereas son preference increases the spacing after the birth 
of a girl relative to after the birth of a boy when prenatal sex selection is 
available.
I introduce a new method that simultaneously accounts for spacing
between births and the potential use of sex selection. 
I apply the method to over four decades of data from India's NFHS.
The results show two very different approaches to son preference.

At one extreme, women without education mostly follow the standard 
pattern of shorter spacing when a woman does not have the desired number of 
sons.
There is also limited evidence of biased sex ratios and the increases in
spacing that should follow from the use of sex selection.
 In the situations where there are elevated sex ratios for women without
education, the spacing patterns are close to those with more regular sex
ratios. 
Hence, it is difficult to conclude that the changes in sex
ratios indicate sex selection rather than normal variation or problems
with recall errors.

At the other extreme, women with eight or more years of education have
experienced an almost complete reversal of the traditional spacing patterns.
Rather than having the next birth sooner as they mostly did before 
sex selection became available, women with either no or one son now 
have substantially longer spacing than if they have two or more sons.
As shown by the increasingly significant deviations in the sex ratio
from the natural sex ratio, these changes are likely due to increased
use of sex selection rather than changes in son preference. 
Banning prenatal sex determination has not been able to
reverse the use, although it is possible that it has slowed the rate 
of increase.

Over the last 40 years, there has been a general increase in median
spacing for all education groups, but especially for the most 
educated women.
The exception is for the spacing between marriage and first birth
where there are two counteracting forces: women have become less likely 
to conceive before marriage, and there has been a substantial compression 
in the variation of spacing.
The result is that median spacing from marriage to first birth
has changed little or even declined for the best-educated women.
Both the decrease for the first spell and the increase for higher-order
spells are consistent with increased access to contraceptives over
time \citep{Yeakey2009}.

The empirical model allows for the effects of covariates
to vary within the spell. 
Non-proportionality is essential because the use of sex selection may 
vary within a spell. 
The use of sex selection may change either because preferences for not 
too long spacing between births override the preference for sons or 
because of selection, where
the women who remain in a spell are those with the strongest son
preference who have been through multiple pregnancies because the
fetuses were female. 
Because these move in opposite directions, I cannot
directly establish the extent to which they affect the results. 
Both are, however, present, as can be seen from the cases where there is
either a decline in sex ratio with spell duration or a substantial
increase with spell duration. 
The first case is most likely at lower
parities where there is still less pressure to ensure a son, which
allows any preference for shorter spacing to play more of a role. 
The second is most likely for higher
parities where the desire to limit further childbearing and ensure a son
dominates any preferences for shorter spacing.


The potential for changes in sex ratio within a spell means that
censoring is an important issue when trying to understand how the sex
ratio changes over time, and especially when it comes to establishing
whether the use of sex selection is increasing or decreasing.
Take, for example, the case of women with eight or more years of
education in the last period. 
If we look at women who started their third spell in either the
2005--2009 or the 2010--2014 periods and we treat end of 2015
as the cut-off point, then the observed sex ratio for the 2005--2009
women is 55.99\% boys while it is 55.38\% for women who started 
in the 2010--2014 period.%
\footnote{
The calculations combines urban and rural women; the basis result 
changes little if I split by area of residence.
I chose the 2014 cut-off to ensure that both groups cover 
five years, even though NFHS-4 took place in 2015 and 2016.
}
It would, therefore, appear that the use of sex selection for
this spell is slightly decreasing over time.
This interpretation, however, ignores the role of censoring.
If we use the estimation results to predict final sex ratio
once childbearing for the third spell is over, the predicted
sex ratios are 56.10\% boys and 56.08\% boys for the 
2005--2009 and the 2010--2015 starts, which indicates
virtually no change over time.
The reason for the difference is that while we would have 
observed 7,134 birth out of a predicted 7,451 total number 
of births for the 2005--2009 start, we would only have observed 
3,348 births out of a predicted 8,842 for the 2010--2014 group.


Although it is not possible to directly observe whether sex selection
causes the unequal sex ratio and longer spacing the results are
consistent with a general increase in sex selection over time. 
The apparent increase in the use of sex selection is mainly found among
women with more education and more so in urban than in rural areas,
although the differences between urban and rural areas are relatively
minor. 
Compared to previous research one result stands out. 
It appears that the use of sex selection is spreading to women with lower 
levels of education.
Even women with one to seven years of education show unequal sex ratios 
and longer spacing for their higher-order spells.

The results here point to two important, interconnected, questions 
for future research:
What is the connection between falling fertility and the 
use of sex selection and is the use of sex selection increasing 
or decreasing over time?
It is clear that fertility has been declining over time in India,
although it is important to note that the decline might be
overstated precisely because of increased use of sex selection and
the resulting longer spacing between births makes it less likely 
that we will observe births to women, even though they eventually
will happen.
The fact that biased sex ratio occurs at lower-order spells over
time and is starting to show up for women with less education 
all indicate that lower fertility and use of sex selection are
related, but a more detailed analysis is needed.
Furthermore, although examining spells separately, as done here, is a useful
first step in understanding how sex selection changes over time,
it does not lend itself easily to examine the degree to which
sex selection changes over time.
For both, a combined model that incorporates the full fertility
history of women would be more appropriate.


The results here also lead to a set of broader questions that
future research should address.
First, to what extent are the improvements in health for girls
relative to boys the result of selection, the longer spacing between
births, or changing son preference?
There is some early evidence that sample selection can make it appear that
girls are healthier, even though the underlying cause is a combination
of sex selection and higher mortality together with recall 
error \citep{Portner2018a}. 
Understanding what role these factors play in better health for
girls is especially important when evaluating policies that 
aim to directly limit the use of sex selection rather than 
changing preferences or incentives.
If the better health outcomes for girls are, for example, an unintended 
side-effect of the longer spacing that arises from sex-selective 
abortions, then an effective ban on sex selection may, at least
temporarily, worsen health outcomes for girls.


Second, we need to understand how female labor force participation
interacts with the use of sex selection.
Increased autonomy for women, arising, for example, from better opportunities
for working outside the home, has been suggested as a way to increase
women's status and thereby lower the use of sex selection \citep{Das-Gupta2016}.
This may, however, be a double-edged sword.
On the one hand, it is a clear benefit to the women who gain  
bargaining power, and it increases the cost of repeated 
sex-selective abortions because the increased duration between births
would cause a stronger disruption in labor market participation.
On the other hand, it may further lower desired fertility, and 
that may, everything else equal, lead to higher use of sex selection.
Understanding the trade-off between long-term benefits from improvements in
women's labor force participation and short-term costs from potential 
increases in sex selection is of paramount importance.

\section{Recall Error and the Sex Ratio}

\setcounter{figure}{0}
\setcounter{table}{0}

The reliability of the results depends on the correctness of the birth histories
provided by the respondents.
A significant concern here is underreporting of child mortality, especially a systematic
recall error where respondents' likelihood of reporting a deceased child depends on the 
sex of that child. 
This section assesses the degree of recall error across the surveys and discusses methods
to address it.

NFHS enumerators probe for any missed births, although the method depends on the survey.
NFHS-1 probe for each calendar birth interval that is 4 or more years.
NFHS-2 asked for stillbirths, spontaneous and induced abortions and also probed 
for each calendar birth interval 4 or more years.
NFHS-3 and NFHS-4 did not directly use birth intervals, but asked whether were there any 
other live births between (name of previous birth) and (name), including any children who 
died after birth, and asked for births before the birth listed as first birth and
after the last birth listed as the last birth.

Probing catches many initially missed births, but systematic recall error based on son
preference may still be a problem.
First, son preference leads to significantly higher mortality for girls than boys.
Secondly, son preference makes it more likely that parents will remember deceased boys 
than deceased girls.
Finally, in the absence of sex-selective abortions, parents with a preference for sons may
have the next birth sooner if the last child was a girl than if it was a boy.
If this girl subsequently dies, she is more likely to be missed if probing for missed 
births is only done for long intervals as in NFHS-1 and NFHS-2.

I use two approaches to examine the degree of recall error.
The first approach is to test whether the observed sex ratio is significantly different
from the natural sex ratio.
Prenatal sex determination techniques did not become widely available until the mid-1980s, 
so any significant deviation from the natural sex ratio before that time is likely the 
result of recall error.
The second approach is to compare births that took place during the same period but
where captured in different surveys.
Recall error is likely to increase with time, so births and deaths that took place earlier 
are more likely to be subject to recall error than more recent events.

Table \ref{tab:recallBirthBO1} shows the sex ratios of children recorded as first-born by 
year of birth, together with tests for whether the observed sex ratio is significantly 
higher than the natural sex ratio and whether more recent surveys have a higher sex ratio 
for the cohort than earlier surveys for the same period births.
Births are combined into five-year cohorts to achieve sufficient power.

\input{../tables/recallBirthBO1.tex}

% \input{../tables/recallBirthBO2.tex}


The ``first-born'' sex ratios illustrate the systematic recall error problem well.
In all four surveys around 55 percent of children reported as first-born are boys
for the first cohort of births observed.
Given that these cohorts cover from 1960-1964 to 1980-1984, which is before sex selection 
techniques became available in India, the most likely explanation for the skewed sex ratio 
is that some children listed as first-borns were not, in fact, the first children born in 
their families.
Instead, for a substantial proportion of families, their first-born was a girl who died 
and went unreported when enumerators asked about birth history.

As expected, the difference between the observed sex ratio and the natural sex ratio is 
less pronounced the closer to the survey date the cohort is.
The observed sex ratio for children born just before the NFHS-1 survey and listed as 
first-born is 0.517, which is not statistically significantly different from the
natural sex ratio.
The same general pattern holds for the other three surveys, with cohorts further away
from the survey date more likely to have a sex ratio skewed male.

% Second births show a pattern very similar to that for first births.
% An interesting difference is that there is evidence of a U-shaped relationship between
% time and sex ratio for second births.
% Cohorts furthest away from the survey year show the highest sex ratios, but declines to the
% natural sex ratio in the mid-1980s, and the sex ratio is then significantly higher again 
% for more recent births.
% This is in line with the results in the main paper that show that sex selective abortions 
% take place on lower parity births as desired fertility declined.

Finally, across surveys, the same cohort tends to show a higher sex ratio the more recent 
the survey (births in the cohort took place earlier relatively to the survey date).
Despite this, few cohorts show significantly different sex ratios across surveys, most 
likely because of a lack of power.
The exception is that comparisons involving NFHS-4 are mostly statistically significant
since the number of surveyed households in NFHS-4 were much larger than in prior surveys.

The problem with the above approach is that the year of birth is affected by recall error; 
for example, a second born child listed as first-born is born later than the real 
first born child.
Recorded year of marriage should, however, be affected neither by parental recall error 
nor the use of sex-selective abortions.
Tables \ref{tab:recallMarriageBO1} and \ref{tab:recallMarriageBO2}, therefore, shows sex 
ratios of children recorded as first-born and second-born by year of parents' marriage, 
together with tests for whether the observed sex ratio is significantly higher than the 
natural sex ratio and whether more recent surveys show a higher sex ratio for the cohort 
than earlier surveys.

The basic recall error pattern remains with women married longer ago more
likely to report that their first-born is a boy.
If anything the pattern is more consistent when using year of marriage than 
year of birth. 
Before the introduction of sex selection there are only two instances  across the two 
parities where the observed sex ratio is lower for women married longer ago than for women 
married closer to the survey date.%
\footnote{
For first-borns it is between 1970--1974 and 1975-1979 for NFHS-3 and for second-borns
it is between 1975--1979 and 1980--1984 for NFHS-1.
}
Similarly, comparing women married in the same five-year period across surveys shows
that women married longer ago are more likely to report having a son.

\input{../tables/recallMarriageBO1.tex}

\input{../tables/recallMarriageBO2.tex}

The relationship between length of marriage and recall error can also seen in 
Figure \ref{fig:sexRatioMarriage}, which shows the observed sex ratio for children reported
as first born as a function of duration of marriage at the time of the survey combining 
all four surveys.
The solid line is the sex ratio of children reported 
as first born by the number of years between the survey and marriage, 
the dashed lines indicate the 95 percent confidence interval 
and the horizontal line the natural sex ratio (approximately 0.512).
To ensure sufficient cell sizes the years are grouped in twos.
In line with the results from Tables \ref{tab:recallMarriageBO1} and 
\ref{tab:recallMarriageBO2}, the observed ratio of boys 
is increasingly above the expected value the longer ago the parents were married.%
\footnote{
The graph for second births shows a similar pattern with the
likelihood of the second child being a boy going up with increasing marriage duration.
The graphs for the second births and the individual survey rounds are available upon request.

\begin{figure}[htp]%

\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{sex_ratio_marriage}
\caption{Sex ratio of ``first'' births by duration of marriage}
\label{fig:sexRatioMarriage}}
\end{figure}

The increasingly unequal sex ratio with increasing marriage duration suggests that
a solution to the recall error problem is to drop observations for 
women who were married ``too far'' from the survey year.
The main problem is establishing what the best cut-off point should be.
As Tables \ref{tab:recallMarriageBO1} and \ref{tab:recallMarriageBO2} shows there are 
differences in recall error across the three surveys and between parities.
One possibility is simply to drop all women married in cohorts where the observed
sex ratio is substantially higher than the natural sex ratio, but even this is not
straightforward.
For ``first'' born this would imply dropping all women married before 1980, but
for ``second'' born it would be imply dropping all married before 1970 for NFHS-1, before 1975 
for NFHS-2, and before 1980 NFHS-3.
Because of the differences between ``first'' and ``second'' born in the different surveys
I vary the cut-off point by survey round.

NFHS-3 is the most straightforward in that the implied cut-off point is the same for
both first and second born.
Based on Tables \ref{tab:recallMarriageBO1} and \ref{tab:recallMarriageBO2}, women in 
NFHS-3 who were married 26 years or
more before the survey date are dropped.
For NFHS-1 and NFHS-2 the trade-off is between ensuring enough information and not bias 
the results unduly.
Given that sex selective abortions are more likely in higher parity birth I base the
cut-off point on the second births instead of the first births.
Hence, for NFHS-1 women who were married 22 years or more before the survey date 
were dropped and for NFHS-2 women who were married 23 year or more before the survey date 
were dropped.
