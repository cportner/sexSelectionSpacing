# N-IUSSP comments

We received the article you submitted to N-IUSSP, and we thank you for that, but we must 
kindly ask you to re-work on it, starting from the attached file, which is your own, but 
formatted in our style, with a few formal changes and several comments

The most critical issue about your paper is that, contrary to our standards and our 
instructions for authors, it contains no table and no graph. Instead, we want them: 
simple, clear and, of course, relevant. In your case, this lack is particularly 
unfortunate, because you are comparing periods (not always clear which ones), and you 
assume that everybody knows everything: e.g., fertility levels and trends, or changes 
over time of birth intervals, or probabilities of further children depending on the sex 
of the first one(s), evolution of sex ratio at birth in India (and neighbouring 
countries, eg. China?) 

Also: is sex selective abortion permitted in India? 
Probably not (although it is happening nonetheless), but this is also something that 
should be said.

Beyond that, the general message of your article is unclear to us. 
Your only concern about sex-selective abortion seems to be about birth intervals 
(even your original title focused only on this - but we suggest that you change both 
contents and title) and the use that scholars should make of them. However, laypersons 
are (correctly) impressed by sex-selective abortions for different reasons (e.g. as 
indicators of backwardness, measures of the need for female empowerment in India, and 
possible causes of distortion in the marriage market in the future), which are not even
mentioned in your article. 

Besides, you seem to say two contradictory things:
a) sex selection at birth is good: it lengthens birth intervals and this saves infant 
lives (although you do not try to estimate how many)
b) sex selection at birth is bad: it lengthens birth intervals and this distorts 
cross-sectional estimates of fertility.
Now, both points may be well taken, but they are not on the same level, and in all 
cases they should be distinguished more clearly.
