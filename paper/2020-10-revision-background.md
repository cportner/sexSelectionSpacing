This section provides a conceptual framework to help understand how birth spacing changes
and guide the subsequent analysis.
I first introduce four "intermediate" determinants of birth spacing: 
desired fertility, economic conditions, desired child outcomes, and son preference.
These are chosen based on prior research covering both Western and non-Western countries 
because of the dearth of research on spacing determinants in non-Western countries 
\citep{Casterline2016,Portner2018}.
Next, I discuss why female education and area of residence are important factors to 
consider in the analysis and how both impact the four intermediate determinants.
Finally, I describe how female education, together with female labor force participation, 
have changed over time in India and how these changes affect our predictions for how birth 
spacing has changed.


Everything else equal, lower desired fertility is associated with longer birth spacing 
\citep{Newman1988}.
[this is weak; why?]
There is, indeed, evidence of substantial increases in birth intervals with declining 
fertility in some non-Western countries \citep{Rutstein2011,Casterline2016}.

Economic conditions may, however, also play an important role.
In India, real wages for both men and women have almost doubled between 1987 and 
2011, although the mean male wage is still close to 70\% higher than the female wage 
\citep{Klasen2015,Bhargava2018}.

Economic theory predicts that the effect of higher wages on fertility behavior is 
determined by the relative strengths of the substitution and income effects.
The substitute effect captures that as a good becomes more expensive relative to other
goods, people substitute away from the now more expensive good and towards other goods.
With higher wages, the substitute effect predicts that people work more and spend less 
time on other time intensive activities, such as children or leisure.
However, higher wages also increases the available income holding hours worked 
constant---that is, ignoring the substitution effect---and this positive income effect 
predicts that people will spend more time on non-work time intensive activities such as 
children and leisure and less time working.

For women, an increasing time cost of children from higher wages, may result in both fewer 
children and \emph{shorter} spacing between children \citep{Hotz1997,schultz97}.
[explain why substitution effect dominates income effect]
[explain why lower fertility does not lead to longer spacing as desired fertility suggests]
If having children requires the mother to reduce her economic activities, 
parents can lower this cost of having children by shortening birth spacing to take 
advantage of economies of scale in childrearing  \citep{Vijverberg1982}.
These effects are more important the more women participate in the labor 
force rather than working at home.

As husbands generally spend little time on child care, the income effect from an increasing
male wage will dominate the substitution effect and, everything else equal, lead to higher 
fertility and possibly longer spacing.
[Need to explain why the longer spacing; may not make much sense given the desired fertility argument]

Parental preferences over child outcomes can also affect birth spacing decisions.
For example, very short spacing---approximately 24 months or less---leads to worse health 
and mortality outcomes for children 
\citep{Whitworth2002,Conde-Agudelo2006,Conde-Agudelo2012,Molitoris2019}.


If more and ``better'' parental attention per child results in higher child ``quality,'' 
we should expect longer birth intervals \citep{Zajonc1975,Zajonc1976,Razin1980}.
However, the evidence on spacing's effect on child quality measures such as IQ 
and education is mixed for developed countries and nonexisting for developing countries
\citep{Powell1993,Pettersson-Lidbom2009,Buckles2012,Barclay2017}.


Finally, as mentioned above, the stronger the son preference, the more likely we are to
see short spacing, and the associated worse health outcomes, when there are no sons 
in the household 
\citep{Whitworth2002,Bhalotra2008,Maitra2008,Jayachandran2011,Jayachandran2017a}.

The introduction of sex selection allows parents to avoid giving birth to girls but 
increases the expected interval to the next birth by 6--12 months.
The increase consists of three parts. 
First, after an abortion, the uterus needs at least two menstrual cycles to recover, 
or the likelihood of spontaneous abortion increases substantially \citep{zhou00b}. 
Second, the waiting time to conception is one to six months. 
Finally, sex determination tests are reliable only from three months of gestation. 
Theory suggests that sex selection increases with lower desired fertility and with
higher parity for a given desired number of children \citep{Portner2015b}.
