To frame our understanding the determinant of birth spacing, a convenient starting
point is a set of possible ``proximate'' determinants based on prior research
covering Western and non-Western countries \citep{Portner2018}: 
desired fertility, economic conditions, mortality risk, and sex composition of children.

Everything else equal, we would expect higher desired fertility to lead to shorter
birth spacing   




 such as household income
and female labor force participation
