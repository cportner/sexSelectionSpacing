There has been surprisingly little research on the determinants of spacing
in non-Western countries \citep{Casterline2016,Portner2018}.
To frame our understanding of the determinant of birth spacing, a convenient starting
point is, therefore, a set of possible "intermediate" determinants based on prior research
covering both Western and non-Western countries:  
desired fertility, economic conditions, mortality risk, and sex composition of children.

Everything else equal, lower desired fertility is associated with longer birth spacing 
\citep{Newman1988}.
There is, indeed, evidence of substantial increases in birth intervals with declining 
fertility in some non-Western countries \citep{Rutstein2011,Casterline2016}.

Economic conditions, however, also play a potentially important role.
Real wages for both men and women have almost doubled between 1987 and 
2011, although the mean male wage is still close to 70\% higher than the female wage 
\citep{Klasen2015,Bhargava2018}.

In general, the effect of higher wages on fertility behavior is determined by the
relative strengths of the substitution and income effects.
The substitute effect captures that as a good becomes more expensive relative to other
goods, people substitute away from the now more expensive good and towards other goods.
With higher wages, the substitute effect predicts that people work more and spend less 
time on other time intensive activities, such as children or leisure.
However, higher wages also increases the available income with hours worked 
constant---that is, ignoring the substitution effect---and this positive income effect 
predicts that people will spend more time on non-work time intensive activities such as 
children and leisure and less time working.

For women, an increasing time cost of children from higher wages, may result in both fewer 
children and \emph{shorter} spacing between children \citep{Hotz1997,schultz97}.
Furthermore, if having children requires the mother to reduce her economic activities, 
parents can lower this cost of having children by shortening birth spacing to take 
advantage of economies of scale in childrearing  \citep{Vijverberg1982}.
These effects are likely to be more important the more women participate in the labor 
force rather than working at home.




Both male and female wages have increased over time in India.


The opposite effect arise from an increasing wage income from the husband, assuming
that he spends relatively little time on child care.
