# Introduction

The introduction of ultrasound in India in the mid-1980s ushered in an era of
significant use of sex-selective abortions.
Sex selection has two major direct impacts. 
One is obvious, more boys are born relative to girls. 
The other less so: with each abortion the time that passes between births increases.  

This duration, also known as spacing, between births is relevant for three reasons.
First, the spacing between births can tell us about the extent of sex selection and
has previously been used to measure son preference.
For example, traditionally, a strong preference for sons has led Indian women to have 
the next child much sooner if they do not yet have a son than if they do.
Second, shorter durations between births negatively affect both mother's and children's
health.
Particularly, very short birth intervals makes it significantly more likely that children 
will die, which means that the traditional shorter birth intervals for women without sons 
may be part of the reason for girls' higher mortality risk compared to boys in India.
Finally, because of how we calculate our most commonly used fertility measures, rapid 
lengthening in birth spacing give the illusion that fertility is declining faster than 
it really is if we follow the number of children women actually end up with.

In a recent paper, I examine how Hindu women's birth spacing has changed over time in 
India, using birth histories covering 1972--2016 from the four National Family and Health 
Surveys [@Portner2021].
I focus on the effects of the spread of sex selection because each sex-selective abortion 
adds 6--12 months to the length of the birth interval.
This extra time comes from a combination of having to wait after an abortion, time to 
a new conception, and the time until the couple is at the same point in the new 
pregnancy as they were in the prior when it was aborted.


# The use of sex selection is not declining

Changes in birth spacing are tightly connected to decisions on whether to have another
child and whether to use sex selection.
In the absence of sons, the desire to use sex selection appears to increase with lower 
desired fertility and higher parity [@Portner2015b;@Jayachandran2017].
Thus, for a given parity, birth intervals should lengthen substantially over time for 
women with no sons, lower desired fertility, and better access to sex selection.

The data show two broad trends over the four decades. 
First, the likelihood of a next birth has decreased over time. 
Not surprising given the son preference in India, the likelihood of having another 
child is much lower if the mother already has one or more sons.
Similarly, more educated mother's and those in urban area have lower likelihood of
having another birth.

Second, sex ratios have become more male-dominated for women with no sons, indicating the 
spread of sex selection. 
Furthermore, in the absence of a son, sex ratios are higher, the more educated the mother, 
and the more children she already has, and are higher in urban than in rural areas. 

Despite predictions that sex selection use will eventually begin to decline, there 
is no clear evidence of this. 
The most likely users of sex selection continue to show substantial male-biased sex ratios. 
More concerning, an increasingly male-biased sex ratios among less-educated women suggest 
that sex selection appears to be spreading as the fertility of this group falls.


# Modest increases in birth spacing, except with sex selection

When sex selection is not used, the median birth intervals have increased relatively 
little---only three to six months over the four decades---compared to around 3.5 months 
*per decade* in other countries with declining fertility [@Casterline2016].
These birth intervals include births to women with no education and to women who have 
already had one ore more sons, no matter their education level.

A remarkably high proportion of birth intervals are still very short. 
For all but the most educated, 25% or more have their second and third child within 24 
months of the previous birth, substantially below the 24 months between pregnancies the 
WHO recommends. 

Even if sex selection is not used in a birth interval, son preference is still evident, 
with the shortest birth spacing when a family has only girls. 
A clear example of this is for rural women with no education---the group least likely
to use sex selection---where birth spacing is much longer when at least one son
is present compared to when they have no sons.

The story is very different when sex selection is used.
Well-educated women with no sons had the most substantial lengthening of birth intervals 
and the most male-biased sex ratios, evidence of very significant use of sex-selective 
abortions. 
For example, among women with 12 or more years of education, almost 80% of third births 
are boys if they have two daughters already.
On top of that, the 75th percentile birth interval length is close to 70 months, an 
increase of almost 21 months over the four decades. 
Even more striking, most of the change took place soon after the introduction of 
sex selection in the mid-1980s.

The result is that some women with no sons now have *longer* birth intervals than those 
with sons, reversing India’s traditional spacing pattern.
This change is clearly not because of declining son preference as it come from
an exploding use of sex selection.
It does, however, hold the possibility that there may be a positive effect on the prior 
girls' health and survival, as girls-only families are now less likely to have very short 
birth intervals. 
Hence, it is possible that better health outcomes for girls when sex selection is 
available is an unintended side-effect, rather than the result of girls becoming more 
valued as is often assumed.


# Spread of sex selection makes us overestimate fertility decline

Our most commonly used measure of fertility is the total fertility rate (TFR), which is 
based on how many births women across all age groups had in a period, often the last year.
Hence, the TFR is not an estimate of how many births a given woman will have but rather a 
measure of period fertility.
A rapidly expanding use of sex selection, which increases the time between births, makes 
the TFR a downward-biased estimate of cohort fertility, which capture how many children a 
family actually ends up with, in what is known as a tempo effect
[@Bongaarts1999;@Hotz1997;@Ni-Bhrolchain2011].

This is exactly what appeared to have happened in India, with the period fertility rate 
substantially overestimating how fast cohort fertility fell in the 1990s and early 2000s 
as spacing initially increased with the spreading use of sex selection. 
Although the two fertility measures have lately been converging, predicted cohort fertility 
is still 10%--20% higher than the period fertility rate. 
To boot, predicted cohort fertility is still at or above replacement level for all 
but the best-educated urban women.

These results paint a less rosy picture of India’s prospects for a continued reduction in 
population growth than generally accepted. 
With predicted cohort fertility still substantially higher than the period fertility rate, 
India’s TFR will likely stabilize or even increase as birth intervals slow their 
lengthening. 
Perversely, the more successful the attempts at combatting sex selection are, the more 
likely an increase in the TFR will be. 
This comes about partly from a reduction in the length of birth intervals if 
sex-selective abortions are not available, and partly from families needing more births 
to reach at least one son.
