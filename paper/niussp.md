# Introduction

Ever since the introduction of ultrasound in India in the mid-1980s, there has been 
substantial use of sex selection.
The use of sex selection has two major direct impacts. 
One is obvious, more boys are born relative to girls. 
The other less so, with each abortion the time that passes between births increases.  

The duration between births is relevant for three reasons.
First, the spacing between births serves both as a measure of son preference and 
provides important information about the extent of sex selection.
In India, for example, the strong son preference has traditionally led to shorter 
birth intervals the fewer sons a woman has.
Second, the duration between births may affect the health of the mother and both 
the prior child and the next child born.
Especially important here is that very short intervals between births increases the 
mortality risk of children.
The shorter birth intervals we traditionally see when women have no sons therefore
are likely part of the reason girls' mortality risk is higher than boys in India.
Finally, because of the way we calculate the most used fertility measures, rapid increases 
in birth spacing can make it appear as if fertility is declining faster than it really is.

In a recent paper, I examined how Hindu women's birth spacing has changed over time in 
India, using birth histories covering 1972--2016 from the four National Family and Health 
Surveys [ref to paper].
I focus especially on the effects of the spread of sex selection because the changes in 
the interval between births from sex selection are likely to be significant as each 
sex-selective abortion adds 6--12 months to the length of the birth interval. 
After an abortion, the uterus needs at least two menstrual cycles---approximately two 
months---to recover, or the subsequent risk of spontaneous abortion increases 
substantially. 
Once conception can be attempted, the waiting time to conception is likely between one and 
six months. 
Finally, sex-determination tests are reliable only from three months of gestation.
Hence, it takes at least six months before the couple is at the same point in the next 
pregnancy as they were in the prior pregnancy when they decided to abort.



# The use of sex selection is not declining

Changes in birth spacing are tightly connected to decisions on whether to have another
child and whether to use pre-natal sex determination technologies on a pregnancy.
In the absence of sons, the desire to use sex selection appears to increase with lower 
desired fertility and higher parity (Pörtner, 2015; Jayachandran, 2017).
Thus, for a given parity, birth intervals should lengthen substantially over time for 
women with no sons, lower desired fertility, and better access to sex selection.

The data show two broad trends over the four decades. 
First, in line with the falling total fertility rate in India, the likelihood of a next 
birth has decreased over time. 
Not surprising given the son preference in India, the likelihood of having another 
child is much lower if the mother already has one or more sons.
Similarly, more educated mother's and those in urban area have lower likelihood of
having another birth.

Second, sex ratios have become more male-dominated for women with no sons, indicating the 
spread of sex selection. 
The percentage of boys born increased more quickly, the higher the education and the higher 
the parity. 
Furthermore, the absence of a son, sex ratios are higher, the more educated the mother, 
and the more children she already has. 
Sex ratios are also higher in urban than in rural areas. 

Despite predictions that the use of sex selection will eventually begin to decline, there 
is no clear evidence of this. 
The most likely users of sex selection continue to show substantial male-biased sex ratios, 
although there may be some leveling off. 
More concerning, the increasingly male-biased sex ratios among less-educated women suggest 
that sex selection use appears to be spreading as the fertility of this group falls.


# Modest increases in birth spacing, except with sex selection

For those intervals where sex selection is not used, the median birth interval lengths 
have increased relatively little---only three to six months over the four 
decades---compared to around 3.5 months per decade in other countries with declining 
fertility (Casterline and Odden, 2016).
This group includes women with no education and women who have already had one ore more
sons, no matter their education level.

Furthermore, a remarkably high proportion of birth intervals are still very short. 
For all but the most educated, 25% or more have their second and third child within 24 
months of the previous birth, which are substantially below the 24 months between 
pregnancies the WHO recommends. 
Even with a more substantial lengthening of birth intervals for higher parities, the 
25th percentile duration is still around 24 months for the fourth spell for women with 
less than eight years of education.

Even if sex selection is not used for a birth interval, son preference is still evident
in people's behavior, with the shortest birth spacing when a family has only girls. 
A clear example of this is for rural women with no education---the group least likely
to use sex selection---where is birth spacing is much longer when at least one son
is present compared to when they have no sons.
Furthermore, the difference in birth interval length across sex compositions has grown 
over time as spacing when sons are present has become longer.

The story is very different when sex selection is used.
Well-educated women with no sons had the most substantial lengthening of birth intervals 
and the most male-biased sex ratios, evidence of very substantial use of sex-selective 
abortions. 
For example, among well-educated women with two girls, almost 80% of their third births 
are boys, and the 75th percentile birth interval length is close to 70 months, an 
increase of almost 21 months over the four decades. 
Hence, this interval has gone from being significantly shorter than the intervals 
with at least one son to now being a significant 13 months longer.
Even more striking, most of the change took place soon after the introduction of 
sex selection in the mid-1980s.

The result is that some women with no sons now have *longer* birth intervals than those 
with sons, reversing India’s traditional spacing pattern of short spacing between
births when a family has only girls.
This change is clearly not because of declining son preference since it arises from
an exploding use of sex selection.
It does, however, hold the intriguing possibility that there may be a positive 
effect on the prior girls' health and survival.
Access to sex selection means that girls-only families are less likely to have very 
short birth intervals, which may reduce sibling competition. 
Hence, better health outcomes for girls with sex selection is available could be an 
unintended side-effect, rather than the result of girls becoming more valued as is often 
assumed


# Spread of sex selection makes us overestimate fertility decline

Our most commonly used measure of fertility is the total fertility rate (TFR), which is 
based on how many births women in each age group had in specific period, often the last 
year.
Hence, the TFR is not an estimate of how many births a given woman will have but rather a 
measure of how many births have occurred in a given period.
Increasing the time between births makes period fertility measures, such as TFR, 
downward-biased estimates of cohort fertility in what is known as a tempo effect
(Bongaarts 1999; Hotz et al. 1997; Ní Bhrolcháin 2011).
That is, a rapidly expanding use of sex selection can make the TFR fall substantially 
faster than cohort fertility, which capture how many children a family actually ends up 
with.

This is exactly what appeared to have happen, with the period fertility rate substantially 
overestimating how fast cohort fertility fell in the 1990s and early 2000s as spacing 
initially increased with the spreading use of sex selection. 
Although the two fertility measures have lately been converging, predicted cohort fertility 
is still 10%--20% higher than the period fertility rate, and the predicted 2005--2016 
cohort fertility is still above the 1992--1993 fertility rate for almost every group of
women. 
To boot, predicted cohort fertility is still at or above replacement level for all 
but the best-educated urban women.

These results paint a less rosy picture of India’s prospects for a continued reduction in 
population growth than generally accepted. 
With predicted cohort fertility still substantially higher than the period fertility rate, 
India’s TFR will likely stabilize or even increase as birth intervals slow their 
lengthening. 
Perversely, the more successful the attempts at combatting sex selection are, the more 
likely an increase in the TFR will be. 
This comes about partly from a reduction in the length of birth intervals if 
sex-selective abortions are not available, and partly from families needing more births 
to reach at least one son.
Furthermore, the rapid decline in infant mortality risk, combined with likely future 
declines as the proportion of very short birth intervals falls, further slows the 
reduction in population growth.
