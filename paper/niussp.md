# Introduction

The introduction of ultrasound in India in the mid-1980s ushered in an era of rapidly 
increasing use of sex-selective abortions. 
One self-evident impact is that more boys were born relative to girls. 
However, each sex-selective abortion also delays the next birth by 6 to 12 months, 
resulting in longer durations between births.

The duration between births---also known as birth spacing---is relevant for three reasons. 
First, increases in spacing can tell us about the extent of sex selection. 
Furthermore, before sex selection, demographers used spacing to measure son preference 
since, traditionally, Indian women had their next child much sooner if they did not yet 
have a son.

Second, shorter durations between births negatively affect both mothers' and children's 
health. 
In particular, very short birth intervals increase child mortality. 
Hence, the traditional shorter birth intervals for women without sons may explain part 
of girls' higher mortality risk compared to boys in India.

Finally, lengthening birth intervals makes our most commonly used fertility measure---the 
total fertility rate (TFR)---decline faster than cohort fertility, which is how many 
children women eventually have. 
This phenomenon is known as a tempo effect. It arises because the TFR is a period 
fertility measure based on how many births women across all age groups had in a given 
period, often the last year [@Bongaarts1999;@Hotz1997;@Ni-Bhrolchain2011].


In a recent paper, I examine how Hindu women's birth spacing has changed over the 
1972--2016 period, focusing on the effects of the spread of sex selection [@Portner2021]. 
The data comes from the first four National Family and Health Surveys. 
In the absence of sons, the desire to use sex selection appears to increase with lower 
desired fertility and higher parity [@Portner2015b;@Jayachandran2017]. 
Thus, birth intervals should lengthen most for women with no sons, lower desired 
fertility, and better access to sex selection for a given parity.


# The use of sex selection is not declining

The data show two broad trends over the four decades. 
First, the likelihood of a subsequent birth has decreased over time. 
Not surprisingly, given the son preference in India, the probability of having another 
child is much lower if the mother already has one or more sons. 
Similarly, more educated mothers and women in urban areas have a lower likelihood of 
having another birth.

Second, sex ratios have become more male-dominated for women with no sons, illustrating 
the spread of sex selection. 
Furthermore, in the absence of a son, sex ratios are higher, the more educated the mother, 
and the more children she already has, and are higher in urban than in rural areas.

Despite predictions that sex selection use will eventually decline, there is no clear 
evidence of this yet. 
The most likely users of sex selection continue to show substantial male-biased sex 
ratios. 
More concerning, increasingly male-biased sex ratios among less-educated women suggest 
that sex selection appears to be spreading as the fertility of this group falls.


# Modest increases in birth spacing, except with sex selection

When sex selection is not used, the median birth intervals have increased relatively 
little---only three to six months over the four decades---compared to around 3.5 months 
*per decade* in other countries with declining fertility [@Casterline2016]. 
These birth intervals cover births to women with no education and women who have already 
had one or more sons, no matter their education level. 
A remarkably high proportion of these birth intervals are still very short. 
Expect for the most educated, 25% or more have their second and third child within 24 
months of the previous birth, substantially below the 24 months between pregnancies the 
WHO recommends. 
Furthermore, in these intervals, son preference is still evident, with the shortest birth 
spacing when a family has only girls.

The story is very different when sex selection is used. 
Well-educated women with no sons had the most substantial lengthening of birth intervals 
and the most male-biased sex ratios, evidence of very significant use of sex-selective 
abortions. 
For example, among women with 12 or more years of education, almost 80% of third births 
were boys if they had two daughters first. 
On top of that, the 75th percentile birth interval length is nearly 70 months, a 
21-month increase over four decades. 
Strikingly, most of this change occurred soon after the introduction of sex selection.

Therefore, some women with no sons now have *longer* birth intervals than those with sons, 
reversing India's traditional spacing pattern. 
Although this change is manifestly not because of declining son preference, it does open 
the possibility of unintended positive effects on the prior daughters' health and 
survival, as girls-only families are now less likely to have very short birth intervals.



# Spread of sex selection makes us overestimate fertility decline


A rapidly expanding use of sex selection increases the time between births, making the 
TFR a downward-biased estimate of cohort fertility. 
That is precisely what appeared to have happened in India. 
The period fertility rate substantially overestimated how fast cohort fertility fell in 
the 1990s and early 2000s, as spacing initially increased with the spreading use of sex 
selection. 
Although the two fertility measures have recently partly converged, predicted cohort 
fertility is still 10%--20% higher than the period fertility rate. 
To boot, predicted cohort fertility is still at or above replacement level for all but 
the best-educated urban women.

These results paint a less rosy picture of India's prospects for a continued reduction in 
population growth than generally accepted. 
With predicted cohort fertility still substantially higher than the period fertility rate, 
India's TFR will likely stabilize or even increase as birth intervals slow their 
lengthening. 
Perversely, the more successful the attempts at combatting sex selection are, the more 
likely an increase in the TFR will be. 
This increase comes partly from reducing the length of birth intervals if sex-selective 
abortions are unavailable and partly from families needing more births to reach at 
least one son.
