# Paper - Revision history

**Background:** 
The paper is essentially a shorter version of my original World Bank working paper.
The original paper went through multiple revisions at *Demography* before finally being
rejected.
My appeal was rejected, but they were open to have me submit a shorter and more focused
version.

sexSelectionSpacing-ver1.tex: This is the shorten version of the last round submitted
to *Demography* with the changes I suggested in my appeal.
