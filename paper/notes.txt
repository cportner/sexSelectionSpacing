[New introduction - 2017-05-22]


Spacing between births has long been used as a measure of son preference 
\citep{Leung1988}.
Before prenatal sex determination became available, the only recourse for
parents who wanted a son, but did not yet have one, was to have the 
next birth sooner.
The result was shorter average spacing after the births of girls than boys,
and worse health outcomes for girls.%
\footnote{
See, for example, 
\citet{Das1987}, \citet{Rahman1993}, \citet{Pong1994}, \citet{Haughton1996},
\citet{Arnold1997}, and \citet{Soest2012} on shorter birth spacing after
girls
and 
\citet{arnold98}, \citet{Whitworth2002}, \citet{Rutstein2005},
and \citet{Conde-Agudelo2006} on the association between shorter birth
spacing and worse health outcomes for girls.
Parents are also more likely to cease childbearing after the birth of 
a son than after a daughter \citep{ben-porath76b,Das1987,Arnold1997,clark00}. 
}

What has not previously been appreciated is that the introduction 
of prenatal sex determination substantially changed the relationship between 
son preference and birth spacing.
The issue is that each sex-selective abortion increases the duration between 
observed births by approximately a year.%
\footnote{
This increase consists of three parts starting from the time of the 
abortion.
First, the uterus needs at least two menstrual cycles to recover 
before conception, because a less than three months space 
between abortion and conception substantially increases the likelihood 
of a spontaneous abortion \citep{zhou00b}.
Second, an average of 6 months to next conception \citep{Wang2003}.
Finally, sex determination tests are generally reliable only from 3 months 
of gestation onwards.
These three parts add up to 12 months.
The waiting time to conception does vary by woman, but even if it is very 
short, say one  month, the additional space between births would still
be 6 months per abortion.
}
We therefore now have a situation where families with the \emph{strongest} son 
preference likely show the \emph{longest} spacing after the birth of a daughter.
But, to further complicate matters, we may still observe short spacing 
after the birth of daughter as a representation of son preference for 
families who---for one reason or another---do not use prenatal sex selection.
In this paper, I introduce and apply a novel method that
directly incorporates the effects of sex-selective abortions on
the likelihood of a son being born \emph{and} the duration between births.
The method can be used to analyse both situations with and without prenatal
sex selection.

How spacing interacts with sex selection is important for two reasons.
First, spacing, by itself, can no longer be used to predict son preference. 
Spacing is still important and useful in understanding son preference, but 
only if combined with the likelihood of observing a boy or a girl.
Short spacing after a girl is indicative of son preference if observed
births are close to the natural sex ratio, where long spacing is indicative
of son preference if observed births are more male biased.
Second, the decision on sex selection may depend on the duration since the
last birth.
For example, as the duration from last birth becomes long enough, parents 
may reverse their decision to use prenatal sex determination,
and carry the next pregnancy to term whether male or female.
This is a problem because, for a given parity, births to women with shorter 
spacing are more likely to be surveyed.


Hence, women for whom we do observe a birth may behave differently from 
the sample of women who have not yet had a birth.



Hence, if decisions on sex selection change with duration since last birth,
the predicted sex ratio for a parity using the current method will be a 
biased estimate of the final observed sex ratio for the parity when 
childbearing is complete.








[contribution]

The main contribution of this paper is the introduction and application of a method that 
incorporates the decisions about birth spacing, and sex-selective abortions.


[health concerns and reversal]

A reversal could happen if they do not want the space between children to be 
``too long'', or if there are concerns about possible infertility as a result of 
too many abortions in a row without a birth.%
\footnote{
Shorter spacing was likely less of a concern to begin with for
better educated mothers---who are also the most likely to use 
sex selection---since their children are substantially less likely 
to be negatively affected by short spacing than children of less 
educated mothers \citep{Whitworth2002}.
}


[Model highlights]

% What are the model highlights 
There are three main conclusions from the model.
The increased use of sex selection shows up both in the 
proportion of boys among births and longer spacing between 
births---and the higher the parity the longer the duration between 
births.
The other factors, such as the price of sex selection, 
discount factor, and son preference also affect the use
of sex selection, but to a much smaller degree.
Second, parents do reverse the use of sex selection, 
both when they use sex selection relatively infrequently and when 
they use it heavily.
Reversal are more likely the more impatient parents are or the
shorter time they have left in their reproductive horizon, which
means that the longer the duration has been since the last birth
the more likely they are to reverse their decision to use sex selection.
Finally, the model shows that son preference in the number of
children is not required for an unequal sex ratio.
As long as parents are only willing to abort female fetuses, declining
fertility will lead to increased use of sex selection to ensure 
a balanced number of sons and daughters.


[More model]
% Empirical method
The model highlights two major limitations of the simple 
empirical method, which a better empirical approach needs to 
allow for.
First, increased use of sex selection leads to longer spacing which,
everything else equal, reduces the number of births available for 
estimation in the simple model and thereby lowers its precision
because fewer parents will make it to a given parity by the time of the survey.
Furthermore, the more intensively sex selection is used the larger 
the decline in sample size.
Second, by using only observed births the simple method cannot capture
when parents change their decision on the use of sex selection;
with a reversal the spell can still result in the birth of a girl.
This last point is especially important when trying to establish whether 
son preference has changed over time in a situation where the cost of prenatal 
sex determination has likely \emph{increased} over time because of the PNDT act.
As I show an increase the cost of prenatal sex determination does 
decrease the sex ratio and lower the number of abortions, but 
it also \emph{increases} the likelihood that parents change their initial
decision to use sex selection within a spell.


Lowering the cost of prenatal sex determination generally leads to 
a smaller percentage of parents who change their use of sex selection.
But, the total number of spells with a change may still
go up because lower cost of prenatal sex determination also
increases the use of sex selection.


For a given sex composition of prior children, there are two main drivers 
of sex selection: the degree of son preference and the cost of sex selection.
The more parents care about having a son as their next child, the more
likely they are to use sex selection and the less likely they are to
reverse the decision once started.
The result is an increased number of abortions, more spells where a
prenatal scan is used, and the spacing between births is longer.

Lowering the cost of sex selection bias the overall sex ratio further 
towards boys.
Correspondingly, both the number of abortions per woman and the
number of spells where a prenatal scan is used should also increase,
resulting in longer average spacing between births.
This increase in spacing is, however, not likely to be uniform across parities.
In addition to increasing the overall sex ratio, lower cost of prenatal 
scan should also lead to use of sex selection at earlier parities.
It is therefore possible to see either no change or a \emph{decrease} 
in average spacing for a later parity---although with a more than compensating 
increase in an earlier parity.
In other words, it is possible for individual parities to show a \emph{decline}
in sex selection at the same time as the overall use goes up.
This is an important caution against over-interpreting individual 
parity results.



[How sex selection can happen in the absence of son preference - just because of balance]

Son preference, however, manifests in two ways in this model.
First, if $\alpha$ is larger than 0.5 parents gain more utility
from having an additional son than from an additional daughter---provided
the had the same number of sons and daughters before.
Second, parents will never abort a male fetus, only a female one.
This explains why even when parents have equal utility from an additional
son or daughter sex ratios still increases as cost of children 
increases and cost of prenatal scans decline.

At $\alpha = 0.5$ parents prefer an equal number of boys and girls.
The more children you have the less likely it is that you will
resort to sex selection to ensure a balance between sons and daughters.
First, the chances of having, for example, only boys or only
girls, decreases with each additional child.%
\footnote{
For 2 children the likelihood of only boys or only girls
is 50\%, but for 4 children it is 12.5\% (assuming equal probability
of a boy or a girl).
}
Second, the more children you have the lower the marginal
utility of having another, which means that, for a given price
of prenatal scan, the less attractive it is to bear the cost of using
prenatal scans to ensure a specific sex.
As fertility fall to, say, two, however, those parents who had a girl as their 
first child will now want to use prenatal sex determination to 
ensure a balanced number of sons and daughters and this is why
the sex ratio is so unbalanced as the cost of children increases.
Parents who had a son as their first child would also want to
use sex selection to ensure both a son \emph{and} a daughter, but since
that option is not available here they have their
second birth without scan.

Stretching the interpretation of the model, think of $\alpha=0.5$ 
as capturing parents treating sons and daughters equally once born.
The use of sex selection to achieve balance---but only when the
fetus is female---could be a potential explanation for the
suggestion that sons and daughters are treated relatively equally and 
we are still seeing an unequal sex ratio.
What is relevant here it that there is no way to identify which 
of these two different types of son preference affect sex ratios 
from fertility data.
This is a concern because the way we currently measure son preference
allows us to capture only the distribution preference, and 
the different types of son preference likely have different policy 
implications.
