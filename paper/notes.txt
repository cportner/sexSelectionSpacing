[Possible text for conclusion]

I use the method to show how spacing between births has changed with
the introduction of prenatal sex determination and how birth spacing plays 
an important role in our understanding of sex selection decisions and 
son preferences.


[Test for differences across survival curves]

Works best for non-crossing survival curves

A potential complication is therefore the fact that for higher spells 
there are substantial differences in the likelihood of ever seeing
a next birth [reference to parity progression literature?].
For example, for the third spell, a family with 2 sons will have a 
low probability of having a third birth and they will likely have it
soonish, but for a family with only daughters there is still a very
high likelihood and the spacing may be substantial because of sex
selection. 
However, the fact that the probability of a third child is very high for 
the only daughter family and low for the only sons family means that
they will have to cross at one point.
A formal test of differences in survival curves therefore has
low power [?]

Maybe it is possible to see whether the survival curves have changed
**more** for girls (moved to the right more) than for boys.
One possibility is to use the median duration among those who will 
have a child by the end of the spell.
It is not clear how I can set up an actual test for this, but maybe
I can use predictnl for this "difference in difference". 
This would be changes in "median" spacing for prior child a girl
minus changes in "median" spacing for prior child a boy.



Alternatively, I could use period dummies to directly test whether
the curves move in different ways, although this is problematic because
of the issues with interpreting multinomial logit results.

[The relation between current approach and my method - provided that I am right!]

Second, the current approach to estimating use of sex selection fails to 
account for the role of spacing.
The current approach uses the sex of children \emph{born} as the outcome
variable in a regression and estimate its association with a set of 
explanatory variables.%
\footnote{
See, for example, \citet{retherford03b}, \citet{jha06}, \citet{abrevaya09},
\citet{Ebenstein2011}, \citet{Jha2011}, \citet{Nandi2013}, and \citet{Hu2015}.
}
In the absence of any prenatal interventions, the probability of having a 
son is approximately 0.512, and this is independent of genetic factors 
\citep{ben-porath76b,jacobsen99}.
With fetus sex random, a statistically significant coefficient therefore 
indicates an association between the variable and use of sex-selective 
abortions.
The problem is that the decision on sex selection possibly depends on the 
duration since the last birth.
For example, as the duration from last birth becomes long enough, parents 
may reverse their decision to use prenatal sex determination,
and carry the next pregnancy to term whether male or female.
For a given parity, births to women with shorter spacing are more likely 
to be captured in a survey, and, if the decision on sex selection
changes with duration, the women for whom we do observe a birth may behave 
differently from the sample of women who have not yet had a birth.
In that case, the predicted sex ratio for a parity using the current method 
will be a biased estimate of the final observed sex ratio for the parity when 
childbearing is complete.


does it make sense to think about a difference in son preference between
two situations where one has a 0.71 sex ratio throughout the entire spell
and one where the son preference results in a 0.71 sex ratio, but
the use of sex selection is declining in spell length?

If you control for age you will run into the problem of missing
lower sex ratio for coming births.

Retherford 2003 controls for age

Does it matter whether a birth is captured by the time it occurs, or
when the prior birth occurred?
Maybe that can lead to potential bias.


[results from current method]

Based on this simple method, we know that families with no sons are more likely to
use sex selection the higher the parity;
that use of sex selection increases with socioeconomic status, especially education;
and that sex selection is more widespread in cities than in rural areas 
\citep{retherford03b,jha06,abrevaya09}.%
\footnote{
There is substantial disagreement on whether sex-selective abortion is used for the 
first birth \citep{retherford03b,jha06}.
}


Our understanding of sex selection usage is, however, constrained by a
lack of information;
there are no official data on sex selection, and the few surveys that ask 
about use of sex selection show signs of serious under-reporting \citep{goodkind96}.

[prior lit using observed sex rations - from appeal]

For small set of published papers that also rely on fertility histories 
to infer sex selection see
% \citet{retherford03b},
\citet{Jha06},
\citet{Visaria2007},
\citet{abrevaya09},
\citet{Ebenstein2011},
\citet{Jha2011},
\citet{Nandi2013},
\citet{Bongaarts2013},
\citet{Hu2015},
\citet{Bongaarts2015}, and 
\citet{Kashyap2016}.
% Furthermore, \citet{Jayachandran2017} rely on 
These all use the traditional method of simply relying on the
observed sex ratio at birth.
As I mention above, the original point of the paper was to show that
this approach is potentially biased and ignores that spacing
becomes longer with use of sex selection.



[Why change use of sex selection within spell - maybe move to data or estimation method]

A number of factors make a reversal of the decision to use sex 
selection between one birth and the next more likely, 
everything else equal.
First, the more concerned parents are about possible infertility 
from repeated abortions or the closer they are to the end of their 
reproductive period, they more likely they are to decide that a 
child of any sex is better than not having a child at all.
Second, the higher the parents' discount factor is---that is, the
more the value present outcomes relative to future outcomes---the
more likely they are to reverse their decision to sex selection.
Third, economies of scale in childrearing---both in terms of time cost 
and direct cost---are easier to take advantage of if births 
are closer \citep[p 947]{Newman1984}.
Hence, the stronger these economies of scale are, the more likely
parents are to reverse their decision to use sex selection.
Finally, if women's wages increase with age, parents prefer
to have their children early and close together while 
the opportunity cost of children is lower \citep{Heckman1976}.%
\footnote{
The time needed to care for young children can also impact 
timing if skills depreciate when out of the labor market \citep{Happel1984}.
Whether depreciation leads to longer or shorter spacing depends
on the specification of the depreciation function.
See also the discussion in \citet[p 315]{Hotz1997}
and references therein.
}
The more pronounced the increase in wage is with age, the more 
attractive it will be to reverse the decision to use sex selection.
Although the latter two factor are most often associated with the literature
on shorter spacing in middle- and  high-income countries, 
the increasing education and wealth in India means that a growing 
portion of the population is likely to behave in a similar manner.%
\footnote{
The possible exception is for the first birth, where the pressure to show 
fecundity---which shortens the duration to the first birth---is potentially 
an important factor in India \citep{dyson83,Sethuraman2007,Dommaraju2009}.

[contribution]

The main contribution of this paper is the introduction and application of a method that 
incorporates the decisions about birth spacing, and sex-selective abortions.


This approach has TK major advantages over the simple method 

Secondly, by explicitly incorporating censoring of birth spacing, it addresses any 
potential bias from ignoring how sex selection decisions may change with duration from 
the previous birth.

The method can better predict ``final'' sex ratios than the simple model

None of these is possible using the simple method.


[health concerns and reversal]

A reversal could happen if they do not want the space between children to be 
``too long'', or if there are concerns about possible infertility as a result of 
too many abortions in a row without a birth.%
\footnote{
Shorter spacing was likely less of a concern to begin with for
better educated mothers---who are also the most likely to use 
sex selection---since their children are substantially less likely 
to be negatively affected by short spacing than children of less 
educated mothers \citep{Whitworth2002}.
}


[Model highlights]

% What are the model highlights 
There are three main conclusions from the model.
The increased use of sex selection shows up both in the 
proportion of boys among births and longer spacing between 
births---and the higher the parity the longer the duration between 
births.
The other factors, such as the price of sex selection, 
discount factor, and son preference also affect the use
of sex selection, but to a much smaller degree.
Second, parents do reverse the use of sex selection, 
both when they use sex selection relatively infrequently and when 
they use it heavily.
Reversal are more likely the more impatient parents are or the
shorter time they have left in their reproductive horizon, which
means that the longer the duration has been since the last birth
the more likely they are to reverse their decision to use sex selection.
Finally, the model shows that son preference in the number of
children is not required for an unequal sex ratio.
As long as parents are only willing to abort female fetuses, declining
fertility will lead to increased use of sex selection to ensure 
a balanced number of sons and daughters.


[More model]
% Empirical method
The model highlights two major limitations of the simple 
empirical method, which a better empirical approach needs to 
allow for.
First, increased use of sex selection leads to longer spacing which,
everything else equal, reduces the number of births available for 
estimation in the simple model and thereby lowers its precision
because fewer parents will make it to a given parity by the time of the survey.
Furthermore, the more intensively sex selection is used the larger 
the decline in sample size.
Second, by using only observed births the simple method cannot capture
when parents change their decision on the use of sex selection;
with a reversal the spell can still result in the birth of a girl.
This last point is especially important when trying to establish whether 
son preference has changed over time in a situation where the cost of prenatal 
sex determination has likely \emph{increased} over time because of the PNDT act.
As I show an increase the cost of prenatal sex determination does 
decrease the sex ratio and lower the number of abortions, but 
it also \emph{increases} the likelihood that parents change their initial
decision to use sex selection within a spell.


Lowering the cost of prenatal sex determination generally leads to 
a smaller percentage of parents who change their use of sex selection.
But, the total number of spells with a change may still
go up because lower cost of prenatal sex determination also
increases the use of sex selection.


For a given sex composition of prior children, there are two main drivers 
of sex selection: the degree of son preference and the cost of sex selection.
The more parents care about having a son as their next child, the more
likely they are to use sex selection and the less likely they are to
reverse the decision once started.
The result is an increased number of abortions, more spells where a
prenatal scan is used, and the spacing between births is longer.

Lowering the cost of sex selection bias the overall sex ratio further 
towards boys.
Correspondingly, both the number of abortions per woman and the
number of spells where a prenatal scan is used should also increase,
resulting in longer average spacing between births.
This increase in spacing is, however, not likely to be uniform across parities.
In addition to increasing the overall sex ratio, lower cost of prenatal 
scan should also lead to use of sex selection at earlier parities.
It is therefore possible to see either no change or a \emph{decrease} 
in average spacing for a later parity---although with a more than compensating 
increase in an earlier parity.
In other words, it is possible for individual parities to show a \emph{decline}
in sex selection at the same time as the overall use goes up.
This is an important caution against over-interpreting individual 
parity results.



[How sex selection can happen in the absence of son preference - just because of balance]

Son preference, however, manifests in two ways in this model.
First, if $\alpha$ is larger than 0.5 parents gain more utility
from having an additional son than from an additional daughter---provided
the had the same number of sons and daughters before.
Second, parents will never abort a male fetus, only a female one.
This explains why even when parents have equal utility from an additional
son or daughter sex ratios still increases as cost of children 
increases and cost of prenatal scans decline.

At $\alpha = 0.5$ parents prefer an equal number of boys and girls.
The more children you have the less likely it is that you will
resort to sex selection to ensure a balance between sons and daughters.
First, the chances of having, for example, only boys or only
girls, decreases with each additional child.%
\footnote{
For 2 children the likelihood of only boys or only girls
is 50\%, but for 4 children it is 12.5\% (assuming equal probability
of a boy or a girl).
}
Second, the more children you have the lower the marginal
utility of having another, which means that, for a given price
of prenatal scan, the less attractive it is to bear the cost of using
prenatal scans to ensure a specific sex.
As fertility fall to, say, two, however, those parents who had a girl as their 
first child will now want to use prenatal sex determination to 
ensure a balanced number of sons and daughters and this is why
the sex ratio is so unbalanced as the cost of children increases.
Parents who had a son as their first child would also want to
use sex selection to ensure both a son \emph{and} a daughter, but since
that option is not available here they have their
second birth without scan.

Stretching the interpretation of the model, think of $\alpha=0.5$ 
as capturing parents treating sons and daughters equally once born.
The use of sex selection to achieve balance---but only when the
fetus is female---could be a potential explanation for the
suggestion that sons and daughters are treated relatively equally and 
we are still seeing an unequal sex ratio.
What is relevant here it that there is no way to identify which 
of these two different types of son preference affect sex ratios 
from fertility data.
This is a concern because the way we currently measure son preference
allows us to capture only the distribution preference, and 
the different types of son preference likely have different policy 
implications.
