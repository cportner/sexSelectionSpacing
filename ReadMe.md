# Sex Selective Abortions and Spacing

**Purpose:** Write paper for Demography based on rejected version. 
This version focuses on the method and spacing.
A separate version will examine fertility and sex selection in more detail.

## Directory structure

You need the following directories for the code to run:

- rawData: original data files.
- code: data cleaning, variables, and analysis
- data: derived data files and results
- figures: generated figures and other figures for paper
- tables: generated tables

In addition, the following directories has writing in them:

- paper: the paper itself, together with snippets and notes
- presentations: various presentations, each its own tex file

##  Generating files

All figures, tables, and pdfs are generated by running `make`.
If you want only a specific file use `make <fileName>`.
See the "Makefile" in the base directory for more information 
on what files are included.

All code assume that you have Stata-SE installed and ready
to run in batch mode (Stata -> Install Terminal Utility if you
are on Mac or Windows; if you are on Unix type system ensure 
that `stata-se` is in your path).
Stata has to be version 13 or better.
Make sure you do not have your profile automatically change
working directory (to something like cd ~/data for example).
If you do, make will not run the Stata files correctly.

The PDF of final paper is created using XeLaTeX with the TeX
Gyre Pagella fonts.
